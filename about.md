I'm the pastor of [Bible Baptist Church](http://biblebaptistmattoon.org) in Mattoon, IL.  I make websites for [sitesfor.church](http://sitesfor.church) and I host the weekly podcast [The Foolishness of Preaching](http://thefoolishnessofpreaching.com).  I use this site to write about things I care about - most often, I write about fundamentalism and church stuff.

### You probably don't care

I'm happily married to Amanda. I've got three wonderful kids (Audrey, Molly and Noah.)  I'm into woodworking, training for triathlons, and cooking pizza.  I was born and raised in New England and am a die hard New England Patriots fan.  I don't follow other sports too closely.  I try to be as apolitical as possible.
