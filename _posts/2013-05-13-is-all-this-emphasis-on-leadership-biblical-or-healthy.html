<p dir="ltr">Just a question here to start off the week:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Is the &ldquo;Leadership&rdquo; emphasis biblical or is it just practical?</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p dir="ltr">We Independent Baptists have our &ldquo;Leadership Conferences,&rdquo; every year a multitude of new leadership books come off of Christian presses, and you&rsquo;ll have no problem finding a multitude of blogs and podcasts featuring some one&rsquo;s tips on &ldquo;leadership.&rdquo;</p></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/leadership-books.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1159" alt="leadership books" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/leadership-books-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p></p>
<p dir="ltr">I&rsquo;m not throwing stones here. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m guilty. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been a long time fan of leadership books. (my favorite secular book is and probably always will be Stephen Covey&rsquo;s<em> The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>.) I listen to Michael Hyatt&rsquo;s <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/thisisyourlife">podcast </a>and Paul Chappell&rsquo;s<em> Spiritual Leadership</em> is one of only three books displayed in my office. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve sat under numerous lectures, both public and personal, on what it means to be a leader. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve attended leadership conferences both as a teenager and as a pastor. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m neither a stranger to, nor have I been a critic of, the leadership theme.</p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Here&rsquo;s the thing that bugs me though - as I read the scriptures, particularly the New Testament, I really don&rsquo;t see<strong> this kind</strong> of leadership emphasis anywhere. &nbsp;I could be missing something, (and if I am, please point it out in the comments) but I just don&rsquo;t see it. &nbsp;If you had to boil down the New Testament to a dozen themes, I don&rsquo;t think leadership would be one of them.</p></p>
<p dir="ltr">(That&rsquo;s not to say that scripture says nothing about leadership. &nbsp;We have the New Testament teaching on the role and responsibilities of church leadership. &nbsp;We have the Old Testament examples from Moses to Elijah and New Testament men like Paul and Peter.)</p></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I just have this nagging feeling in the pit of my stomach that the leadership emphasis has a lot more to do with the spirit of the age than the spirit of the book.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I think it contributes to the unbiblical goal of having your church turn into a mega-church (and thus &nbsp;puts undue pressure on pastors all over the country.) &nbsp;One more thought - could it be that the leadership emphasis contributes to the trend to reduce a church to it&rsquo;s pastor (and de-emphasizes&nbsp; the corporate work of the church?)</p><br />
Please don't read this to mean I'm against any emphasis on leadership, I just think it should be tempered by what the New Testament actually emphasizes.</p>
