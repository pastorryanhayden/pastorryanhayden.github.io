<p><strong>Recently I dusted off my <a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/web-design-services/">web design business</a>.</strong> Since I&rsquo;ve become a pastor, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of not needing to do much outside work, but circumstances have made it plain to me that I need some outside income, and for me, outside income has always meant making web sites.</p>
<p>I talk to lots of people interested in making web sites: small business owners trying to do it themselves, the guy at the church who is unlucky enough to be given responsibility over the church website, and young &ldquo;I want to be a designer when I grow up&rdquo; types. Whatever their reasons, I think that&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>If you are one of those people, I want you to be able to gain from my experience. So here is:</p>
<h2>Five things every aspiring web designer needs:</h2></p>
<h3>1. Realistic expectations</h3><br />
When I started making websites a decade ago, I thought you could do the whole thing in photoshop. I went into photoshop and laid out an awesome looking website, used the photoshop button tools (which i don&rsquo;t even think exist anymore) to make buttons and links, and uploaded a massive (for then) webpage that worked correctly on almost 0 browsers.</p>
<p>Having accomplished this - I set out to start a web design business. My first paying web site job was for a seasoned graphic designer. I was really just pretending at that point.</p>
<p>I was foolish. I was naive.</p>
<p>Ten years and who knows how many websites later, I am less, not more, confident in my design and coding ability than I was then. Web design is a lot of work, and there is a lot to know.</p>
<p>On top of basic graphic design skills. You really need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML &amp; CSS</li>
<li>A little about web standards</li>
<li>A little about information architecture</li>
<li>A little about user experience and interaction design</li>
<li>How to use a web host</li>
<li>How to use FTP</li>
<li>What responsive design is</li>
<li>How to make mobile web sites</li>
<li>How to use Wordpress or another Content Management System</li>
<li>The list could go on&hellip;</li><br />
</ul><br />
So if you want to learn web design - go for it. But have realistic expectations getting into it. Expect to spend a lot of time over the course of years teaching yourself the things above. Expect long hours where you feel like banging your head against a desk and throwing your monitor out the window. Realize you are taking on a massive and rapidly transforming subject that you probably will never stop learning about.</p>
<p>If you have that mindset from the beginning, you&rsquo;ll be halfway there.</p>
<h3>2. Learning resources:</h3><br />
I think every beginning web designer should have at least these learning resources:</p>
<h4>A Primer</h4><br />
In my opinion, the very best book for beginning web designers is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Build-Your-Website-Right-Using/dp/0987090852/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1405712962&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=build+your+own+website+the+right+way+using+html+%26+css+3rd+edition">&ldquo;Build Your Own Website From Scratch the Right Way Using HTML and CSS&rdquo;</a> by Ian Lloyd. It&rsquo;s been around forever, and has been updated several times, but if you read it carefully it will get you a very good basic introduction to web design and development.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Build-Your-Website-Right-Using/dp/0987090852/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1405712962&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=build+your+own+website+the+right+way+using+html+%26+css+3rd+edition"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1885" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-07-18-at-2.50.11-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-07-18 at 2.50.11 PM" width="219" height="299" /></a></p>
<h4>The Boagworld Podcast</h4><br />
<a href="http://boagworld.com">Boagworld</a> is a British Web Design podcast that&rsquo;s been going on forever. Its entertaining, and informative, and if you listen to it&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>you&rsquo;ll stay up to date with what&rsquo;s going on in the web design world.</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll learn about new trends.</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll learn the sources the pro&rsquo;s turn to.</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll learn about best practices.</li><br />
</ul><br />
You will get a better education about web design and development by just listening to that podcast and researching the stuff they talk about than you would ever get in a college course on web design.</p>
<h4>Learning websites</h4><br />
<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1886" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-07-18-at-2.53.12-PM-300x171.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-07-18 at 2.53.12 PM" width="300" height="171" /></a></p>
<p>On top of Boagworld, I recommend you read these websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com">Sitepoint</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com">Smashing Magazine</a></li>
<li><a href="http://alistapart.com">A List Apart</a></li><br />
</ul></p>
<h4>Some design galleries</h4><br />
You are going to need to know what good web design looks like, and there is probably no better way to learn than looking at a lot of great websites. For this purpose, web design galleries are an invaluable resource. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://csselite.com/category/showcase">CSSelite</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cssremix.com">CSSremix</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cssmania.com">CSSmania</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/inspiration/">Smashing Magazine</a></li><br />
</ul></p>
<h4>Books</h4><br />
All of these things are going to fill you with a desire to learn more about specific areas of web design. So expect to buy a lot of books. These books can get pretty expensive, and there are a lot of them out there. Three web design focused publishers that usually put out great books are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=sitepoint">Sitepoint</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=smashing+books&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Asmashing+books">Smashing</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=a+book+apart&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aa+book+apart">ABookApart</a></li><br />
</ul><br />
I told you this wasn&rsquo;t going to be easy, but this is the cost of being a good web designer.</p>
<p>The third thing you&rsquo;ll need, after tenacity and some learning resources is&hellip;</p>
<h3>3. A testing environment</h3><br />
You are going to need a way to test sites locally on your computer. The easiest way to do this on a Mac is with a free program called <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/">MAMP</a>, on Windows, you can use a free program called <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WAMP</a>.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1887" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-07-18-at-2.57.59-PM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1887" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-07-18-at-2.57.59-PM-300x227.png" alt="MAMP running on my computer" width="300" height="227" /></a> MAMP running on my computer[/caption]</p>
<p>These programs will put a folder on your computer that basically acts like a web host. You can set up wordpress or another CMS on it and play around as much as you want without other people seeing your work.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this step doesn&rsquo;t cost money, and is fairly easy to set up.</p>
<p>The fourth thing you will need is&hellip;</p>
<h3>4. Layout Software</h3><br />
The gold standard layout software for web design is <a href="http://adobe.com">Photoshop</a>. That&rsquo;s what I used for about 10 years. But I don&rsquo;t use it anymore.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost - Adobe Photoshop costs $10 a month (or you can get all of adobe&rsquo;s tools for $50 a month.) That&rsquo;s really not that bad, but if you stop paying the subscription, you lose the ability to edit all of the files you&rsquo;ve created.</li>
<li>Usability - Adobe Photoshop, as it&rsquo;s name suggests, is made for editing photos. It was never intended to be used for laying out websites. So it&rsquo;s kind of a cumbersome solution.</li><br />
</ul><br />
So what do you use if you don&rsquo;t use photoshop? An even better solution, in my opinion, also happens to be much cheaper. If you have a Mac, you can use the program that I now use, called <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> (by Bohemian Coding.) It&rsquo;s very simple, easy to use software that is built for interface design (think web design) and it&rsquo;s very, very powerful. It also has the added benefit of costing only $79.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1888" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-07-18-at-3.00.13-PM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1888" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-07-18-at-3.00.13-PM-300x170.png" alt="A mockup I'm working on in sketch." width="300" height="170" /></a> A mockup I'm working on in sketch.[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can lay something out in Sketch in a small fraction of the time it would take me to do the same thing in Photoshop and the finished product is much more web friendly. Plus, Sketch runs much, much faster on my aging MacBook than Photoshop did.</p>
<p>You can download a free 14 day trial of Sketch <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Coding Software.</h3><br />
You are going to need coding software. O.k., you don&rsquo;t need this. You can actually get by with the textedit app built into your mac or the notepad app built into your PC. But you are going to <strong>want</strong> coding software.</p>
<p>A word of caution here - stay far away from WYSIWYG programs (Like dreamweaver, flux or rapidweaver) and learn to code. If you really want to learn Web Design, there is no way around this.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the very best coding program is called <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/">Espresso</a>. (Unfortunately, like Sketch, it&rsquo;s Mac Only.) What makes Espresso the best? It does what all of the similar programs do: it highlights your code, helps autocomplete tags, and helps you keep your code organized but where Espresso shines is in the way it handles CSS. There used to be a product called CSSedit that was the best way to style a website. CSSedit is no more, but the entire product has been brought into Espresso and updated.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1889" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-07-18-at-3.05.47-PM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1889" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-07-18-at-3.05.47-PM-300x219.png" alt="A CSS file in Espresso.  Notice the inspector on the right - very powerful." width="300" height="219" /></a> A CSS file in Espresso. Notice the inspector on the right - very powerful.[/caption]</p>
<p>You may have no idea what that means now, but let me tell you, when you start getting into serious CSS, you&rsquo;ll appreciate it. You can try and buy espresso here.</p>
<p>A free alternative to Espresso that also runs on Windows is <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a>. It&rsquo;s not as feature rich as Espresso, but it is a great code editor and, well, it&rsquo;s free. You can find out about Brackets <a href="http://brackets.io">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Sixth thing you&rsquo;ll need is&hellip;</p>
<h3>6. An FTP Program.</h3><br />
When you finally have a web site done, you&rsquo;ll need an FTP program to get it onto a web host. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol and is a secure way to transfer files to a web host. A great free (they ask for donations) program is <a href="http://cyberduck.io">Cyberduck</a>. This is available on both the Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Other great FTP programs include <a href="http://www.binarynights.com">Forklift</a> (what I use), <a href="https://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a>, and <a href="https://filezilla-project.org">Filezilla</a>.</p>
<h3>7. A project to start on.</h3><br />
Once you&rsquo;ve read some books, set up a testing environment, and learned some software. You&rsquo;ll need a project.</p>
<p>If you really want to get into web design, your best first project will probably be a personal web site for yourself. Because it&rsquo;s your web site, it can be terrible, it can evolve quickly, and it can change often. So set up a personal site and then work on improving it.</p>
<p>As your confidence builds, then start taking on other sites. Start small and simple, and work your way up to complex.</p>
