<p><em>Below is chapter three from the book I've been working on "We've Got Issues" about being an independent Baptist pastor. Here are links to the <a title="Help Me Finish My Book" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/help-finish-book/">introduction</a>, <a title="We&rsquo;ve Got Issues &ndash; We&rsquo;ve Abandoned Biblical Preaching" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wevegotissuespreaching/">chapter 1</a> and <a title="Issues Chapter 2: Intellectuals" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/issues-chapter-2-intellectuals/">chapter 2</a>.</em></p>
<h1>Issue 3: We Worship Successful Leaders</h1></p>
<h2>The Ideal</h2></p>
<h3>Ideally, IFB pastors would recognize that scripture commands us in no uncertain terms not to glory in men.</h3><br />
<a class="bibleserver extern" href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians3%3A21" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 3:21</a> could not be more plain. It says <em>"Therefore let no man glory in men."</em> The word <em>"glory"</em> in that verse means &ldquo;to boast in&rdquo; or &ldquo;to rejoice in&rdquo;. When you study out the context of that verse, you find that the "men" it refers to were preachers, among whom was the author, the apostle Paul. This is an absolute command, worded as strongly as any command in the New Testament, against glorying in preachers.</p>
<p>A few verses earlier it says <em>"For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?37</em>" Think about that. Paul was making the assertion that the fact that these Corinthian believers were bragging about their favorite preacher and splitting into factions over it was a sure sign that they were spiritual immature. According to God's Word, if you worship at the feet of a preacher then you are not spiritually mature.</p>
<h3>Ideally, IFB pastors would realize that no man is flawless, and every message must be tested against the Word of God.</h3><br />
The book of Acts commends the Berean jews saying <em>"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."</em> When we remember that they were listening to the Apostle Paul and he was preaching to them the gospel of Christ, it's easy to marvel that God commends them for what some people would say is a critical attitude. No one is perfect. No one&rsquo;s message is perfect. No one is above rebuke. The apostles Peter made mistakes and had to be publicly rebuked38. The apostle Paul spoke acknowledged his own struggle with sin39. There has only been one infallible Man and He was crucified at Calvary.</p>
<h3>Ideally, IFB pastors would realize that no matter what we seem to accomplish, it is God who does the work.</h3><br />
Scripture tells us <em>"So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.40"</em> If our work matters at all, it is God's work, and not our own. As Jesus told the Pharisees, he could raise up prophets out of the stones. In the Old Testament, at times God accomplished His purpose through donkeys, prostitutes, heathen kings, and nothing but his own hand. God does not need men.</p>
<p>In light of this, Paul says <em>"He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.41"</em> God wants Christians to spend their time making much of Him, not making much of themselves.</p>
<h3>Ideally, IFB pastors would strive for a humble, servant minded attitude in their ministry.</h3><br />
Right after girding himself in a towel and washing his disciples feet, Jesus said <em>"but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister42".</em> Jesus clearly expected his followers to have humble hearts of service and he clearly modeled that better than any man. As Paul reminded us in <a class="bibleserver extern" href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Philippians2%3A5-7" target="_blank">Philippians 2:5-7</a> <em>"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:"</em></p>
<p>Clearly, the apostles and Bible writers understood this. Over and over again in scripture, they identify themselves as <em>"the servant of Christ"</em>, making as little of themselves as possible. Just like John the Baptist, we need to have humble hearts toward each other and realize that we aren't even worthy to unbuckle Christ's shoes, never mind be called his servant. Our attitude should always be <em>"He must increase, but I must decrease."</em></p>
<h2>The Reality</h2><br />
Despite the ideal, there are many in fundamentalism that worship "successful" preachers, and their are many "successful" preachers who encourage it. There are Bible college presidents who require every student to take a course on their life. There are pastors who put things on their church sign or in ads like "the most exciting preacher in America." There are leaders who run their ministries with the spirit of a tyrant and who are shameless in their self-promotion.</p>
<p>You would think, given what scripture clearly teaches, that these things wouldn&rsquo;t be tolerated and that preachers who act like this, no matter how &ldquo;successful&rdquo; would be making themselves an island. Unfortunately, there are many pastors all over the country who are willing to be their copycats and minions, and who will go to all ends to gain their approval or attention. They will line up to buy their books, spend vast sums of money attending their conferences, and treat them with a cultic loyalty that no man deserves.</p>
<p>There are also preachers ("successful" or not) who boastfully refer to themselves as "the man of God" and who train their people to give them standing ovations each time they approach the pulpit. There aren't many places where openly narcissistic, self-promoting people can fit in, but some of them are doing rather well as pastors of Independent Baptist churches. Of course men like this are in the minority in fundamentalism, but they are a loud and active minority, and they give Independent Baptists a bad name.</p>
<p>Have preachers always acted this way?</p>
<p>J. Frank Norris was one of the founder of fundamentalism and a man that pastored two of the first megachurches in America at the same time. Besides the souls won in those churches, God used Norris in a great way through his newspaper and as the founder of the Bible Baptist Seminary. He was a man with national influence both inside and outside of churches, and a man who was personally acquainted with several presidents of the United States. Many well known preachers, both inside and outside of the Independent Baptist Church movement admitted a great gratitude for his ministry and leadership.</p>
<p>He was a man that was used by God, he was also a narcissist with a huge hunger for self promotion. As a freshman at Baylor, he told a group of ministers &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to preach in the greatest pulpits and greatest cities in the world and I&rsquo;m going to build the greatest church in the world.43&rdquo; That spirit never really left him. The masthead of his newspaper featured a photo of him shining a flashlight on the devil. He once told a group of reporters &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t say something good about me, say something bad, just say something.44&rdquo; Not only was he a narcissist, but his ego would tolerate no detractors. When his friend and fellow preacher John R. Rice questioned him about unfairly criticizing a small town pastor, Norris ran an article in his paper denouncing John R. Rice45.</p>
<p>While most of us don&rsquo;t remember J. Frank Norris, another complicated, big name preacher from Texas had an equally well documented love for self-promotion: Jack Hyles. Dr. Hyles pastored the largest Independent Baptist Church in America, founded Hyles-Anderson college, and ministered to thousands of pastors every year through his &ldquo;Pastor&rsquo;s School.&rdquo; For many years, Dr. Hyles was the face of fundamentalism, and he seemed to know it too. The evidences of Jack Hyles self-promoting tendencies are many. Here are just a few examples: he named his college Hyles-Anderson, he allowed people to refer to him as one of the world's greatest men, he had allowed a gigantic mural of himself to be placed on a wall outside of his church and he boasted of &ldquo;having the steering wheel of fundamentalism&rdquo; and said things like &ldquo;if I fall, America falls with me&rdquo;; incredibly, he even had his boyhood house dismantled in Texas and set up as a museum to him in Indiana.46</p>
<p>Hyles inspired a whole host of Independent Baptist followers who worship him and refuse to admit one negative thing about his ministry. I know many pastors who talk about the wonderful influence of Jack Hyles on their life and I believe them, but there is a big difference between honoring a former pastor and worshipping him in cult like intensity. I&rsquo;ve personally heard pastors pray to the deceased Jack Hyles and jokingly refer to him as the &ldquo;fourth member of the Trinity.&rdquo; I know pastors who will not allow anyone who didn&rsquo;t go to Hyles Anderson to speak from their pulpit. I often wonder how all of these people interpret commands like &ldquo;let no man glory in men.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>How Do We Fix This?</h2></p>
<h3>Strive to lift up Christ and Christ&rsquo;s church, no ourselves.</h3><br />
The purpose of the ministry isn&rsquo;t to grow a church and make a name for ourselves, it is to lift up Christ and follow His orders. As a pastor, I have been given the awesome responsibility of taking care of something that Christ gave His very blood for. I don&rsquo;t even begin to qualify. I hope that visitors come away from my church saying &ldquo;what a savior,&rdquo; not &ldquo;what a preacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ won&rsquo;t be lifted up by accident. If we take for ourselves the place of preeminence, then how can He have it? As pastors, we need to make less of ourselves and more of our Savior.</p>
<h3>Admit to the mistakes of our past.</h3><br />
I am convinced that one of the reasons that this tendency toward self-promotion perpetuates, despite the clear teaching of scripture, is because certain people become too &ldquo;big&rdquo; for any criticism. Men like Jack Hyles, J. Frank Norris, and Billy Sunday were undoubtably influential to the Independent Fundamental Baptist movement and there work needs to be recognized and appreciated, but they were human beings with human beings faults. The fact that they were such public figures makes their faults all the more noticeable. When we talk about these men, their faults need to be recognized and pointed out, or these men&rsquo;s historical status will make their faults legitimate. Too often, the faults of great men are copied by those who have none of their redeeming virtues, and this is justified because &ldquo;Dr. Hyles did it.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Repent of the notion that a church is its pastor.</h3><br />
I pastor what I feel is one of the greatest churches in America. It isn&rsquo;t huge and it isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it&rsquo;s made up of people who truly care for each other, who love God&rsquo;s word, and who are faithful to God&rsquo;s house. For the most part, I &ldquo;inherited&rdquo; these characteristics of our congregation, they have little to do with me being the pastor. If God&rsquo;s work at Bible Baptist church is limited to what I can do, then our church will be a colossal failure. I am so grateful that I have witnessed at our church and others I have served the supernatural impact faithful laymen can make.</p>
<p>The idea that the church revolves around &ldquo;the man of God&rdquo; is an idea that, in my opinion, has lived out its usefulness. Of course the pastor plays A central role in the church through his leadership and teaching of the Word. THE central roll, however, needs to be God and his work through the people of the church. God has promised <em>&ldquo;I will build my church&rdquo;</em>, he never promised he would build the church of Ryan Hayden. We must remember that it is when we <em>&ldquo;lift up the cross&rdquo;</em> that God will draw all men to himself.</p>
<h3>Demand humility in our leadership.</h3><br />
I am grateful that God has raised up men in our times whose ministries are being touched by God and who are specially equipped to offer leadership by example from afar. (Fortunately, most of these men don&rsquo;t seem to have the same desire for self-promotion as the leaders from a generation ago.) I also realize, however, that I pastor an autonomous, independent church and those men have no control, direct or otherwise, over what we do. While I appreciate their ministry and leadership, they will quickly lose this follower if they start promoting themselves over Christ or start boasting about the greatness of their church. Ego doesn&rsquo;t operate long in a vacuum of applause. If we don&rsquo;t follow people who are narcissistic, they will either amend their ways or cease to be leaders.</p>
