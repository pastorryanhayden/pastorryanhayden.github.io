<p><em><strong>Warning</strong>: what follows is sarcastic. It&rsquo;s a tongue and cheek list. It is borderline satire and making fun. I don&rsquo;t normally do that.</em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m posting it anyways because as sarcastic and as over-the-top as it is - it does seem to be the playbook many people use when answering criticism. Before you even read it - know this - there is a better way. It&rsquo;s the way found in passages like 1 Corinthians 13:4-7, 2 Timothy 2:24-26, and James 3:13-18. But, because so many people seem to be above sincere and loving dialogue of the biblical kind, this list may help remind them what to do.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>First and foremost it is absolutely important that you do not consider the validity of the criticism AT ALL. You are being criticized - therefore it is invalid.</li>
<li>If you do, in some moment of weakness, accidentally consider what is being said, never let this be known and under no circumstances respond to the person criticizing you. This would lend credence to the idea that the criticism <strong>could</strong> be valid, and because you are perfect, you know that isn&rsquo;t true.</li>
<li>Make zero distinction between a person criticizing your ideas or your actions and a person criticizing you personally.</li>
<li>Take every criticism, no matter the critics intention, as a personal affront.</li>
<li>When someone does criticize you - the best response is calling that person an undesirable name. The accuracy of this name doesn&rsquo;t matter. If the critic is young, inexperienced, has supporters you don&rsquo;t like, or went to church once without a tie in 6th grade, by all means, point it out. (By the way, this isn&rsquo;t about the person criticizing you, it&rsquo;s about YOU. You are name calling more for your own benefit than you are to advance any kind of discussion. The discussion was invalid from the beginning. Remember? Because you are perfect and all criticism is thus invalid.)</li>
<li>If you have any notoriety, many people will be on your side regardless of the truth. Often, they will do the dirty work of name calling and reputation bashing for you. This is desirable. You should either leave them alone or fan the flames. If they go beyond what is truthful, that&rsquo;s a small price to pay for protecting your own ego.</li>
<li>Along with personal insults, do everything you can to align yourself with respected leaders of yesteryear. If you can make people think that any criticism of you is by proxy a criticism of a beloved historical figure, you can go a long way in insulating yourself from all criticism.</li>
<li>Brag on your personal accomplishments. Especially if you feel they far outweigh the accomplishments of the critic. This has no bearing on the original conversation, and will likely mean nothing to the critic, as he probably knows of your accomplishments, but it will further make you look good in the eyes of some bystanders.</li>
<li>Use this bulletproof logic to blast your critics: I am doing God&rsquo;s work > They are criticizing me > Therefore, they are criticizing God&rsquo;s work.</li>
<li>Remember that the important thing isn&rsquo;t winning a person - that person is too far gone - the important thing is winning a battle and another notch for your gun.</li><br />
</ol><br />
<strong>P.S. If you feel this list stings, do something about it:&nbsp;Actually answer questions.</strong> You may be right and your critics may be wrong, but the way to go about proving that is in the realm of <em>ideas</em> and ideas require a <em>conversation</em>. <strong>Nothing kills a conversation faster than insults.</strong></p>
<p>So with that in mind, heres another list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Listen carefully to what is being said. Don&rsquo;t listen to answer, listen to understand.</li>
<li>If there is some possibility that the criticism wasn&rsquo;t intended to destroy you then answer it by either defending your original statement/action, clarifying your thought process or apologizing.</li>
<li>Try as much as possible to keep ideas separate from those holding them. Think of people with false ideas as people held captive by the deceiver. Love them enough to convince them of the truth.</li>
<li>Refuse to take all criticism of your actions as a criticism of you. Realize that people may like or love you and have a real problem with what you say or do.</li>
<li>Never respond to criticism by insulting the critic. This just makes you look petty. The best response to a valid criticism is a valid response. The best response to a petty criticism is no response.</li>
<li>If people come to your defense in an inappropriate way, graciously correct them and remind them that justice, love and truth are more important than winning a minor battle.</li>
<li>Keep the criticism in perspective, don&rsquo;t bring others into it unless the critic brought others into it.</li>
<li>Deal with what was said. It&rsquo;s fair in rare cases to admit you don&rsquo;t have an answer and to point people to your accomplishments and ask them to trust you, but only after the criticism has been dealt with. Going to accomplishments first may give people the impression that you think you are perfect and above criticism.</li>
<li>Just because you are serving God with your life doesn&rsquo;t mean that you are perfect and could not improve. God&rsquo;s work is bigger than any one man, and the Truth is more important than your ego.</li>
<li>Try very hard to win your critics. The only way to do this is to consider their criticisms and to show a care for their eternal soul and spiritual wellbeing in all of your interactions. If you must cut them, cut them with a scalpel and not with an axe. As soon as you cross over the line between trying to help and trying to hurt, you&rsquo;ve lost the battle and made the conversation pointless.</li><br />
