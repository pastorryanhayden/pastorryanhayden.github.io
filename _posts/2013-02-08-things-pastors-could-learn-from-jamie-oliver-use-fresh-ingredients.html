<p><em>This is the fourth post in a series of <strong>&ldquo;Things Pastors Could Learn from Jamie Oliver.&rdquo;</strong> Please consider reading the <a title="Five Things Pastors Can Learn From Jamie Oliver: Introduction." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/five-things-pastors-can-learn-from-jamie-oliver-introduction/">introduction</a>, as well as the <a title="Things Pastors Could Learn From Jamie Oliver: Be Authentic" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/things-pastors-could-learn-from-jamie-oliver-be-authentic/">first</a> and <a title="Five Things Pastors Can Learn From Jamie Oliver: Have a Huge Vision" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/five-things-pastors-can-learn-from-jamie-oliver-have-a-huge-vision/">second</a> lesson.</em></p>
<p>As I talked about in yesterday&rsquo;s post, Jamie Oliver is the champion of &ldquo;cook it fresh, cook it yourself&rdquo; eating. Unlike most of the voices telling us to eat healthier, Jamie Oliver isn&rsquo;t so much trying to change what we eat as he is trying to change where it comes from and how it is prepared. He is convinced that if everybody learns how to cook and learns how to use the ingredients that they can grow themselves, that America and Britain will be much healthier places.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-07-at-8.59.02-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-581" alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-07 at 8.59.02 PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-07-at-8.59.02-PM-300x167.png" width="300" height="167" /></a></p>
<p>Because of this Jamie Oliver&rsquo;s tends to focus on the food. When he does a cooking show, it&rsquo;s not all about presentation, it&rsquo;s about finding high quality ingredients and cooking them in some simple way so that others can enjoy them.</p>
<p>I think the principle that pastors could learn from this is:</p>
<h1 id="usefreshingredients.">Use fresh ingredients.</h1><br />
As pastors we are primarily tasked with feeding our people the Word of God. Most of us are spending the majority of our working weeks preparing a spiritual meals for our church family. Using cooking as a metaphor for this, I think we can learn something from Jamie Oliver&rsquo;s (actual) cooking emphasis.</p>
<h2 id="dontjustreheat.">Don&rsquo;t just reheat.</h2><br />
In Jamie&rsquo;s Food Revolution, Jamie Oliver went around West Virginia trying to educate families about the high cost of cheap food. He talked with one family whose children were all dangerously obese and found that the mother never cooked beyond heating up frozen pizza&rsquo;s and dropping french fries. In one scene, Oliver piled a week&rsquo;s worth of this food onto her kitchen table to make it clear just how much junk was going into her families bodies. His point was clear: American&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t cook, they reheat, and it&rsquo;s killing us.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-07-at-9.13.12-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-585" alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-07 at 9.13.12 PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-07-at-9.13.12-PM-300x164.png" width="300" height="164" /></a></p>
<p>Our people take several hours out of their weeks in order to come and hear the word of God preached and taught. They deserve more than a reheated message from our glory days or some &ldquo;fast food&rdquo; sermon we found on the internet. They deserve a fresh cooked meal.</p>
<p>Two things motivate me to stay in the word: First, when I preach I try to be conscious of the fact that my sermon is an offering to the Lord and should be my very best. Second, I remind myself that a thirty minute sermon doesn&rsquo;t take thirty minutes of time, but 30 minutes x however are in attendance that night. So if I give them 30 minutes of fluff I might be wasting 40 hours of peoples time. God and my church deserve more than that.</p>
<h2 id="getyouringredientsfromthesource.">Get your ingredients from the source.</h2><br />
Jamie Oliver thinks that everybody should have an herb and vegetable garden and should learn to cook from it. I am no gardener, but I did grow a patch of hot peppers, basil, parsley and rosemary in my backyard and found the experience to be pretty awesome. (I&rsquo;m planning on extending it this next year.)</p>
<p>As a pastor in 2013, I can access hundreds of preaching books on my kindle. I have in my library a series of dozens of books full of &ldquo;classic sermons on (almost any subject)&rdquo;, I can pull up almost all of the sermons Charles Spurgeon preached on the internet and I can even buy books of pre-made sermons for the entire year.</p>
<p>While I am grateful for sermon books and commentaries, there is something to be said about getting your sermons from the source - God&rsquo;s Word. Nothing else is <em>&ldquo;given by inspiration of God&rdquo;</em> and nothing else is <em>&ldquo;profitable &hellip; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h2 id="focusoncontentnotpresentation.">Focus on content, not presentation.</h2><br />
One of my favorite things about Jamie Oliver as a chef is that he has a total aversion for high-brow food and over presentation. Most of the recipes he teaches feature ingredients you can buy at Wal-Mart. His cookbooks feature real food, on real looking plates, in real looking kitchens. The focus is always on the food, not on the presentation.</p>
<p>Too often pastors get caught up on the presentation of their sermon at the expense of biblical content. Whether it is preaching at a yell, preaching with a drawl, preaching &ldquo;three points and a poem&rdquo; or preaching every message for an invitation. They have a few set recipes in their head for what a sermon should look like and try to force the biblical food into those recipes.</p>
<p>Presentation is important. Just as you enjoy a meal served in a clean dining room on nice plates more than one served in a messy kitchen on paper, sermons are more palatable when the preacher at least consider&rsquo;s presentation. But content trumps presentation every time.</p>
<p>Charles Spurgeon said <strong>&ldquo;The golden rule of keeping people&rsquo;s attention is to say something worth listening to.&rdquo;</strong> Nothing is worth listening to more than the truth which sets us free.</p>
<p><strong><em>Let&rsquo;s quit reheating. Let&rsquo;s quit preaching from commentaries or old sermon notes. Let&rsquo;s quit focusing on garnishes and side dishes. Let&rsquo;s go out into the garden of our own study of God&rsquo;s Word, and consistently serve our people solid, healthy biblical meals.</em></strong></p>
