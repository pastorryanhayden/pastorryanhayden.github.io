<p>(This post is a part of a series on <em>Why We Fight: A Defense of Pushing for IFB Reform</em>. It may be helpful for you to<a title="Why We Fight: A Defense of Pushing for IFB Reform." href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/fight-defense-pushing-ifb-reform/"> read the introduction</a> to get caught up.)</p>
<p>One refrain that seems to be repeated constantly in the sermons, tweets, blog posts and books of "old guard" IFB defenders is that young pastors are a bunch of compromising misfits looking to justify their own lack of standards. The idea seems to be that we young pastors have jettisoned any idea of holiness, and are looking for change so that we can be comfortable with our compromise. <strong>In other words, we want something that is less than salvation, surrender, standards and soul-winning.</strong></p>
<p>In my experience, they couldn't be more wrong.</p>
<p>While I can't speak for every young independent Baptist pastor (I've certainly seen some decisions they've made that are cause for question) I can say that in my experience, the young independent Baptist pastors that I know are very conservative. They have "standards" (although like me, they might not always like the word.) They use only the King James. They believe in modesty and separation from the world.</p>
<p>We aren't trying to get rid "standards" or "the old-time religion" we are trying to add some Biblical standards for our generation.</p>
<p><strong>We want more, not less.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For me, I've got a standard that I won't promote or associate with a pastor or preacher who twists the scripture to fit his cause.</li>
<li>I've got a standard that I won't promote or closely associate with a preacher who "glories in men" and seems to be hung up in man worship.</li>
<li>I've got a standard that I won't promote or associate with a preacher who doesn't pass the <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/James3%3A13-18" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">James 3:13-18</a> or <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians13%3A4-7" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</a> tests.</li><br />
</ul><br />
All of those "standards" come directly from the pages of scripture. They are just as clear if not clearer than the traditional "standards" that have been handed to us from generations before, yet they are constantly compromised within fundamentalism.</p>
<p>So why do we fight? It's not about justifying compromise - it's about calling out the compromisers. It's not about having less standards, it's about going back to the Bible and taking up the standards we forgot.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I'm going to give another reason we fight: The Neighborhood Watch Theory.</p>
