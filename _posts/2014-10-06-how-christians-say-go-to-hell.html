<p>There is probably nothing harsher that a Christian could say to a person than &ldquo;Go to hell.&rdquo; To wish someone to be eternally tormented is inhumane and just downright evil. It is completely foreign to the New Testament attitude that &ldquo;would have all men to be saved&rdquo; and it is a complete denial of our our God given &ldquo;ministry of reconciliation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, I&rsquo;ve found that in the way Christians often talk about people, &ldquo;Go to hell&rdquo; is what they are saying in practice, if not in actual words.</p>
<p>We say &ldquo;go to hell&rdquo; when we call people names. We say &ldquo;go to hell&rdquo; when we mock people. We say &ldquo;go to hell&rdquo; when we treat our intellectual opponents as enemies.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t follow me, let me lay it out for you in three propositions:</p>
<h3>1. God has given us a ministry of reconciliation.</h3><br />
Our goal is to get people to accept Christ and be reconciled to God and the truth. We are in the ministry of CONVERTING people. That involves a change of mind. Literally, we are out to change people&rsquo;s mind about God, about the Bible, about morality, etc.. Our greatest weapon in that change is the gospel, the truth that God loved the world so much that He gave his only Son to take the penalty for our sins and to free us from the penalty, power and one day the presence of sin. It is a message intended to reconcile man to God.</p>
<h3>2. You don&rsquo;t convert people by attacking them.</h3><br />
Quick. List all of the times in your life when you changed your mind because someone attacked you, called you a name, or treated you like dirt not worthy of existing. While you are thinking about that and making a list, I&rsquo;ll go live the rest of my life because it doesn&rsquo;t happen. No one get&rsquo;s their mind changed by attack. When we are attacked, we just dig in further. We meet attack with defense and counter attack. As Charles Spurgeon used to say &ldquo;the mind changed against its will holds the same opinion still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you are honest with yourself, you don&rsquo;t call people names for their benefit, you call people names for your benefit. Sometimes, in the best case scenario, you may do it to warn others, but most of the time, you do it to make yourself feel good, or superior, or powerful or right.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my third proposition:</p>
<h3>3. When you treat people like an enemy to be destroyed or a stone to be stepped on, you might as well be saying &ldquo;go to hell.&rdquo;</h3><br />
It is not &ldquo;the ministry of reconciliation&rdquo; that causes us to make fun of people we disagree with, it is the ministry of self-recommendation. It displays a calloused heart towards others and pride towards ourselves. Practically, we are telling people we don&rsquo;t care about them as a person and that they might as well go to hell.</p>
<h2>There is a better way.</h2><br />
It&rsquo;s called <em>&ldquo;preaching the truth in love.&rdquo;</em> It&rsquo;s called <em>&ldquo;in meekness instructing those who oppose themselves.&rdquo;</em> It&rsquo;s called <em>&ldquo;some having compassion, making a difference.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Going after converts instead of casualties requires the following at a minimum:</p>
<h3>We&rsquo;ve got to be gentle with people.</h3><br />
2 Timothy 2:24 says <em>&ldquo;And the servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men.&rdquo;</em> James 3:17 says <em>&rdquo;But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated...&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Gentle is a word that means kind or tender. It&rsquo;s a way to describe people who don&rsquo;t want to harm others. It&rsquo;s the exact opposite of the attitude that says &ldquo;nuke em all.&rdquo; When a combative person takes up a battle axe, a gentle person takes up a scalpel.</p>
<p>So what about truth? Do we ignore uncomfortable truths? Do we tell people nothing they don&rsquo;t want to hear?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<h3>We&rsquo;ve got to instruct people.</h3><br />
2 Timothy 2:24 goes on to say <em>&ldquo;Apt to teach, patient.&rdquo;</em> Then the next verse says <em>&ldquo;In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>You see, we have the sword of Truth. The beautiful, double edged sword. But our sword isn&rsquo;t meant for killing people, it&rsquo;s meant for healing them.</p>
<p>Your favorite teacher in school was most likely not the person who belittled you in front of the whole class and called you a moron. He was most likely the guy who went to where you were at, and led you step by step to a better place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we have to look at our dealings with others. With obvious patience and care for their wellbeing.</p>
<p>I submit that there is far too much name calling and rhetorical grenade throwing and not enough meek instruction of those that oppose themselves. I think there is too much &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to let them have it&rdquo; and not enough &ldquo;you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.&rdquo; One method shows our compassion, the other method shows our superiority and callousness to others. &nbsp;One method is looking for converts, the other for casualties and those two things are worlds apart.</p>
<p>Who have you told to go to hell lately?</p>
