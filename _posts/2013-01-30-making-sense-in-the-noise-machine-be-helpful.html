<p>This is part 4 of a series of posts on <strong>&ldquo;Making Sense in the Noise Machine.&rdquo;</strong> My personal rules for sharing content and commenting on the internet.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, you may want to read the <a title="Making Sense in the Noise Machine.  (My rules for sharing in blogs and social media)" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/making-sense-in-the-noise-machine-my-rules-for-sharing-in-blogs-and-social-media/">introduction</a>, and my <a title="Making Sense in the Noise Machine: Be Informed." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/making-sense-in-the-noise-machine-be-informed/">first</a> and <a title="Making Sense in the Noise Machine: Be Idea Driven." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/513/">second</a> rules.</p>
<p>[/box]</p>
<p>My third rule for posting and sharing on the internet is:</p>
<h1 id="behelpful">Be Helpful</h1><br />
On of my favorite Bible verses (It&rsquo;s hung on the wall in my office) is:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient.&rdquo;</em> <strong>2 Timothy 2:24</strong></blockquote><br />
Often, as a result of human nature (and the fact that I was raised by and around people from Massachusetts), I don&rsquo;t want to be gentle. I want to fire off a sarcastic remark. I want to belittle. I want to write people off as &ldquo;an idiot&rdquo; and get on with my day.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/surgery.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-530" alt="surgery" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/surgery.jpeg" width="276" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t be that way, not if I truly want to act like a Christian. Hostility, harshness are the opposites of <em>&ldquo;gentle&rdquo;</em>. Fighting is the opposite of <em>&ldquo;must not strive.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>As I said in my last post, as a Christian, I am not after casualties, I&rsquo;m after converts. That requires an altogether different disposition than one hunkered down in a me vs. them battle. As James says <em>&ldquo;The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>So how do you post on a social network or comment on a blog post, especially if you disagree with it, and be helpful?</p>
<p>I try to do the following:</p>
<h2 id="beathermometernotjustathermostat.">Be a thermometer, not just a thermostat.</h2><br />
In other words, don&rsquo;t just point out what is wrong, try to fix it. If someone has ideological cancer, don&rsquo;t just resign them to die, point them to the cure. Give them information. Ask probing questions.</p>
<p>This kind of helpfulness requires a commitment to dialogue, which also entails a commitment to civility&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="donoharm.">Do no harm.</h2><br />
Their is a difference between discussing ideas and attacking people. When I lived in Tennessee, if someone came up to me and said &ldquo;It seems like Yankees have a tendency to be harsh and sarcastic.&rdquo; That would have been the start of an interesting conversation. Most people don&rsquo;t have time for that, so what I heard was &ldquo;Yankee&rsquo;s are stupid.&rdquo; Where does that leave me?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll go a lot farther with people if you refuse to attack them personally and weigh how your remarks will make them feel.</p>
<p>One of a doctor&rsquo;s primary tools is a scalpel, a tool for cutting into our flesh. Sometimes to help people, you may have to hurt them, but like a doctor, we need to keep the incision as small as possible and be very careful about it. If you have to disagree, make your cuts with an ideological scalpel, not the axe of an insult.</p>
<h2 id="addvalue.">Add value.</h2><br />
If my post can&rsquo;t add value, then what&rsquo;s the point in my posting? If I&rsquo;m not elevating the conversation, I&rsquo;m either bringing it down or wasting my breath.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things that can add value:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suggestions</strong><br />
I&rsquo;ve already covered this under &ldquo;Be a thermostat&rdquo; but sometimes a humble suggestion goes a long way. At the very least, a suggestions says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking out for you and this may be in your best interest.&rdquo;</li></p>
<li><strong>Encouragement</strong><br />
I&rsquo;ve been blessed to have many friends all over the country that send me encouraging notes and emails. One of the reasons I keep writing is because I have people cheering me on. Whenever I read something I find valuable, I always try to thank the writer, especially if he isn&rsquo;t well known. I know it helps me.</li></p>
<li><strong>Information or resources</strong><br />
If a post is about a specific subject, there is nothing wrong with pointing people to a book, web site, or blog post where they can find more information. It&rsquo;s a positive gesture and usually will be appreciated.</li><br />
</ul><br />
