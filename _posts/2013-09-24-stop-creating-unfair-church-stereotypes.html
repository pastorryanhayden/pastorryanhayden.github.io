<p>Whether you realize it or not, most of your decisions are made subconsciously.  This is actually a good thing.  It's the way God made us.  As best as researchers can tell, we catalogue experience into a kind of brain database that controls our subconscious actions.  If we didn't have this subconscious system, driving home from work would take hours and would cause us nervous fits.</p></p>
<p>We often make subconscious decisions without experience, however, and that's a problem.  It's especially a problem when we make subconscious decisions about the character of other people, because we aren't making those decisions based on knowledge of their person - but on preconceived stereotypes.</p></p>
<p>Here's the problem with stereotypes: they are always created by extremes because it is only the extremes that we hear about.  It's also the nature of our brain.  We don't hear about normal people, we hear about extremes.  When Joe Brown goes to work for his family for the 15,373 consecutive workday it doesn't make news.  When Jack Brown goes to the mall and guns down three people it does. So all we know of the Browns is that one of them went on a crime spree and we form a stereotype that Browns are a bunch of crazy criminals.  Silly example but it makes sense.  </p></p>
<p>As an independent Baptists, two dangerous things happen all of the time. First, we have no interaction with non-IFB Christians, so we depend on stereotypes.  Second, we constantly tell stories about the worst cases of non-independent baptists so we create stereotypes that cause people to think that all non IFB people are consciously disobedient rank heretics.</p></p>
<p>Now this is a problem for two reasons:</p></p>
<p>First, it's not just.  There are Christians that love God, that stand for truth and that love God's Word outside of our circles.  Forming stereotypes, whether  consciously or not, based on the worst cases among them is uncharitable towards the majority in those groups.</p></p>
<p>If your struggling with this, let me bring it home. Do you want people thinking of Westboro Baptist Church (the God hates fags group), Jack Schaap or Peter Ruckman when they think of independent Baptists.  We instinctively say &ldquo;that's not fair&rdquo; whenever people do this to us, but then we go ahead and use the same tactics for Southern Baptists or Bible church believers or whatever.</p></p>
<p>Second, it's not true.  When we instill the thought &ldquo;they&rsquo;re all a bunch of liberals&rdquo; in the minds of our hearers, we aren't installing truth.  All that needs to happen is for our people to meet one Christian outside of our group that loves God and his Word and we&rsquo;ve lost total credibility.  </p></p>
<p>God is a God of justice and truth, He&rsquo;s also a God of holiness. Our quest for ecclesiastical holiness doesn't give us the right to jettison truth and justice.</p></p>
<h3> added for clarification</h3></p>
<p>I did not intend for this to mean that we should stop "earnestly contending for the faith" or that we should stop practicing ecclesiastical separation.  I merely am saying that we should contend with precision and with charity.  We should apply "just war theory" to our contentions meaning we should 1) seek as little damage as neccesary and 2) seek only to contend with enemy combatants.  We need to stop using a-bombs when a single bullet would do.</p>
