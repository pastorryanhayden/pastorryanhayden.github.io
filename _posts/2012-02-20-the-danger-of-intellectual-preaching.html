<p>Last week, I posted about the <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/?p=156">dangers of exciting preaching.</a> &nbsp;<em>(Please read that before this, as this post will seem very one sided if you don't)</em> This week, as promised, I want to counter with the dangers of intellectual preaching.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/bean_church_sleep.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-175 alignleft" title="bean_church_sleep" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/02/bean_church_sleep-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>While fundamentalism seems to be overrun with people who go to extremes trying to be exciting, evangelicalism tends to be overrun with people going to extremes trying to sound smart. (Before my evangelical friends through out the &nbsp;<em>false dichotomy dodge</em>, I am speaking in generalities. I am fully aware that there are people of all shades who identify as both.)</p>
<p>In this post I want to prove, if just anecdotally, that one extreme is as dangerous as the other. So here are some dangers of intellectual preaching:</p>
<h3>Intellectual preaching tends to ignore application.</h3><br />
As a part of preacher's command to "preach the word" we are told to reprove, rebuke, and exhort. We are told that all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, yes, but also for reproof and correction. If Paul's writings are an example, our preaching should be equal parts doctrine and application.</p>
<p>Summing all of this up, preaching should be practical. It shouldn't just make us change our mind, it should make us change our lifestyle.</p>
<h3>Intellectual preaching can be mistaken for professional preaching.</h3><br />
While there are many people who try to be exciting preachers who are relying on a painted kind of fire, no fire is necessary to be an intellectual preacher. In other words, it takes effort to pass yourself off as an exciting preacher if it's just a job, but it takes no effort at all to pass yourself off as an intellectual preacher, no matter how dispassionate you are about it.</p>

<p>There are far to many pulpits in our country filled week to week by people who are so dispassionately intellectual, their hearts couldn't be warmed by an inferno. As my old pastor (who had about 100 post grad credits under his belt) used to say</p>
<blockquote><p>"Seminary is the place where they take young men with great hearts and minds and turn them into young men with great minds."</blockquote><br />
If fundamentalists today are to be equated to the <em>pharisees</em>, making up a bunch of extrabiblical rules for people to follow, too many self-labelled evangelicals are like the <em>scribes</em>, willing and able to argue for hours over how many angels can dance on the head of a needle.</p>
<p>Most preachers today show far more passion when talking about whether they are monergists or synergists, whether they are dispensationalists or covenanters, calvinist or arminian and so on and so forth than they do talking about the need of a lost world or about the grace freely given in Christ.</p>
<p>Charles Spurgeon said that the most essential quality of a preacher is <a href="http://www.reformed.org/master/index.html?mainframe=/books/ltms/Lecture_II.08.html">earnestness</a>. Preachers should aim at light (teaching) first, but they should also include <a href="http://www.spurgeon.org/misc/aarm06.htm">fire, faith, life and love</a>.</p>
<p>Are you putting as much effort into making <em>disciples of Jesus Christ</em> as you are into making others into <em>monergistic reformed liberated evangelicals</em>? Just saying.</p>
<h3>Intellectual preaching can easily be over people's heads.</h3><br />
Our supreme example in preaching is the Lord Jesus Christ. While he was definitely a teacher who didn't shun the deep truths or the controversial subjects. He spoke in the language of the people. He used simple, concrete, unexpected, emotionally charged language. He told stories. He explained God's word in a way that the common people could understand.</p>
<p>Education is valuable. We are commanded to study. We are to labor in doctrine. All of this is true.&nbsp;In all of this we need to be careful, however, not to become the kind of stuffy, verbose, abstract, pensive intellectual <em>sand men</em> that have been the bane of the ministry since there has been a ministry.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
