<p>One oft repeated claim by secularists is that religion is responsible for most, if not all, of the violence in the world.&nbsp; It seems they want us to believe that if everybody was a left leaning atheist, then we would all beat our swords into plowshares and the lions would lay down with the lambs.</p></p>
<p>But events like this weeks "Chick-fil-a shooting" have to be a glass of cold water to the secularist face, beckoning them back to reality.&nbsp; If you haven't heard, a homosexual activist attempted to break into the D.C. offices of that notorious "hate-group" the Family Research Council. An organization whose greatest crime was not lending their support to a bill in congress intended to express national disapproval of the executing of homosexuals in Uganda.&nbsp; The Family Research Council stated that they believed in the purpose of the bill and were against the execution of homosexuals, but could not support the bill because of it's broad sweeping statements about human sexuality.</p></p>
<p>Anyways, this man storms the D.C. office of the family research council armed with a 9mm Pistol, a backpack full of ammo, and 15 Chick-fil-a chicken sandwiches (no really!).&nbsp; When the security guard denied him entrance, he shot the security guard in the arm.&nbsp; I don't know what this man intended to do with so much ammo and so many chicken sandwiches, but I can only guess it was some form of violence.</p></p>
<p>My point is this: when can we Americans stop pretending that the leftists and secularists among us aren't religiously committed to their unpopular agenda.</p></p>
<p>Are Bible believing Christians storming into the offices of planned parenthood or the North American Man-Boy Love Association with backpacks full of ammo and Ben and Jerry&rsquo;s Ice Cream? No!&nbsp; Nor will they ever if they are true Bible believers, because God's word commands us to "love our enemies."&nbsp; Our greatest crime is stating that God says homosexuality is sin (along with lying and pride) and that marriage should be reserved for men and women.</p></p>
<p>I am not saying that this man is representative of all leftists, nor am I saying that there are no crazy and violent people who identify with Christianity.&nbsp; (Although if the tables were turned, you could almost guarantee that that would be the tactic of the leftists.)&nbsp; What I am saying is that Americans need to wake up to the extreme anti-Christian bias that has so much influence in our culture today and they need to filter through the politically correct dribble coming at them from the media.</p></p>
<p>It is not religion that incites violence like this, it is commitment to ideas and ideals.&nbsp; Chick-Fil-A and I happen to be committed to ideas and ideals that include loving our neighbor, turning the other cheek, and helping people.&nbsp; Get off our back.</p></p>
