<p>I believe in ecclesiastical separation. I take the command of scripture to <em>&ldquo;mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.&rdquo;</em> (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Romans16%3A17" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Romans 16:17</a>) very seriously. I believe that we should <em>&ldquo;earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints.&rdquo;</em> (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Jude2" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Jude 2</a>)</p>
<p>However, I think that those verses tend to be applied in only one direction - out. They are applied by a movement - fundamentalism - to those outside of the movement. Very rarely do fundamentalists take those verses and apply them to other fundamentalists.</p>

<p><em><strong>But there is cause to do so.</strong></em> So not only am I going to mark and separate those who teach false doctrine or deny scripture or practice continuationism or whatever. I&rsquo;m also going to be marking those guilty of the following traits:</p>
<h2 id="abuseofthebible.">1. Abuse of the Bible.</h2><br />
If you want to be a fundamentalist and stand shoulder to shoulder with me in defense of the truth. You had better care enough about that truth to tell me what it actually says, and not to twist it&rsquo;s meaning to suit your purposes. Do not preach to me <em>&ldquo;where there is no vision the people perish&rdquo;</em> unless you explain the connection to <em>&ldquo;but he that keepeth the law happy is he.&rdquo;</em> Do not try to preach a series of messages from some Old Testament historical book and read your own meaning into every aspect of it. Do not allegorize, spiritualize, or eschatologize a text until it means nothing close to what it originally meant. Stop telling us what the verse means to you and start telling us what it means. &nbsp;Make sure that your homiletics are built on hermeneutics.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/2Peter1%3A20" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">2 Peter 1:20</a></blockquote></p>
<h2 id="teachinganabridgmentofbiblicalsalvation.">2. Teaching an abridgment of biblical salvation.</h2><br />
The gospel is simple. Simple enough for a child to understand. Simple is not the same as simplistic. &nbsp;It is complex enough to take up the book of Romans. In fact, it is complex enough to give us something to talk about for all of eternity.</p>
<p>In presenting the gospel, be sure to emphasize what the Bible emphasizes - salvation from sin. Be sure to present a biblical Jesus. We are not going around giving out &ldquo;get out of Hell free&rdquo; cards, we are attempting to see people born again. Quit pushing the &ldquo;one, two, three - pray with me&rdquo; junk and get back to the biblical emphasis of faith and repentance that brings new life in Christ.</p>
<p>A biblical view of salvation is pretty fundamental. If the gospel isn&rsquo;t worth separating over, what is?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Matthew13%3A52" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Matthew 13:52</a></blockquote></p>
<h2 id="teachinganabridgmentofbiblicalchristianity.">3. Teaching an abridgment of biblical Christianity.</h2><br />
While we are talking about abridging things. Please stop trying to turn Christianity into a checklist. You really must think God has a problem communicating himself because if He wanted Christianity to be a checklist then He could have made it much simpler for us and just given us one. He didn&rsquo;t. He gave us His Word and He said we need all of it. People aren&rsquo;t going to get all of it through your twelve topics and they certainly aren&rsquo;t going to get it all through the fifteen messages you&rsquo;ve preached on neo-evangelicalism this year. Preach the Word.</p>
<p>What is the difference between a person who denies half of the Bible and a person who ignores half the Bible?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be consistent.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: 17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/2Timothy3%3A16-17" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">2 Timothy 3:16&ndash;17</a></blockquote></p>
<h2 id="narcissism.">4. Narcissism.</h2><br />
Jesus said the greatest among us would be our minister. He himself took the form of a servant. Paul compared pastors to farm laborers, sub-contractors, bond slaves and household managers. Humility is a theme of the Bible and a necessity for the ministry.</p>
<p>You are not the greatest preacher who ever lived. It&rsquo;s not about you. You are not America&rsquo;s pastor. America will get on just fine without you. God will raise up another man. He may do a better job than you.</p>
<p>Egotistical people do not belong in the ministry. &nbsp;Let's let them be egotistical in a vacuum of applause and with no followers. &nbsp;See how long that lasts.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;&hellip;for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Peter5%3A5" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Peter 5:5b</a></blockquote></p>
<h2 id="encouragingpreacherworship.">5. Encouraging preacher worship.</h2><br />
While we are on this. You don&rsquo;t need a standing ovation every time you preach. If you are doing your job right, you&rsquo;re just passing on a message, not creating one. If people start praising you and worshipping you, you had better put them in their place. All the glory and honor and praise belongs to Him which sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb.</p>
<p>Stop promoting yourself and get back to Bible preaching. Here&rsquo;s an idea for a starting passage - take a couple of months to preach through <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians1%3A4" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 1&ndash;4</a>. It deals with many things, but the central problem in those verses is preacher worship.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians3%3A21" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 3:21</a></blockquote><br />
I&rsquo;m not going to remain in fellowship and collaboration with someone who turns a sin God gave us four chapters on into a virtue.</p>
<h2 id="encouragingoffactionalism.">6. Encouraging of factionalism.</h2><br />
One more thing. If you are demanding loyalty to yourself or to an institution, rather than the Lord and His church, then consider yourself marked and avoided. I&rsquo;m glad you have a polo shirt from your Bible College alma mater for every day of the week, but if you can&rsquo;t stomach the thought of anyone going anywhere else, or you can&rsquo;t fellowship or preach with people who don&rsquo;t come from your little circle, then your loyalty isn&rsquo;t to Christ and those for whom He died, it is to a manmade, fallible institution.</p>
<p>Factions are going to happen. Fights are going to come. But if you are going around causing factions and looking for fights, and reveling in the fray, I don&rsquo;t think you are displaying biblical wisdom.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/James3%3A18" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">James 3:18</a></blockquote></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><br />
Let&rsquo;s be consistent fundamentalists. Let&rsquo;s keep an eye on our own sins and shortcomings. Let&rsquo;s not only mark those who are clearly guilty of attacking scripture from outside our ranks and miss those &ldquo;causing divisions&rdquo; standing right next to us.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fundamentalism isn&rsquo;t worth fighting for. Biblical Christianity is.</strong></em> If you, like me, believe that Biblical Christianity includes the idea of fundamentalism, then let&rsquo;s act like fundamentalists to those fundamentalists who have forgotten the two most fundamental things in Biblical Christianity: the Bible and Jesus Christ.</p>
