<p>Two years ago, I set out to write a book. The proposed title was <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got Issues, But I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be anybody else.&rdquo;</em> It&rsquo;s a book I haven&rsquo;t finished. I&rsquo;ve just about finished the <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got issues&rdquo;</em> part, but I haven&rsquo;t got very far into the <em>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be anybody else.&rdquo;</em> My plan was to write several chapters about the historical genesis of the independent Baptist movement, and to write about foundational problems in other Baptist groups and why I feel like &ldquo;independent Baptist&rdquo; is still the best place to be.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of months, I&rsquo;ve been paying attention to what is going on in the largest other group of Baptists, the Southern Baptist Convention.</p>
<p><em>Now, let me be swift to say that I like a lot of Southern Baptist guys</em>. My wife and I&nbsp;listen to Albert Mohler&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/category/the-briefing/">&ldquo;The Briefing&rdquo;</a> almost every day and have for over a year. I also read and enjoy most of Dr. Mohler&rsquo;s books. (Dr. Mohler, probably more than anybody else, is THE leader in the SBC right now.) I&rsquo;ve enjoyed much of <a href="http://www.sermonaudio.com/search.asp?SpeakerOnly=true&amp;currSection=sermonsspeaker&amp;keyword=Paul%5EWasher">Paul Washer</a>&rsquo;s preaching ministry. I think our local SBC pastors are great guys and faithful pastors. There are many SBC guys whose ministry has blessed me.</p>
<p>There are also other compelling benefits to being in the Southern Baptist Convention:</p>
<ul>
<li>The SBC has some great educational and financial benefits for it&rsquo;s member pastors.</li>
<li>The SBC has a fairly strong network (for promotion).</li>
<li>The SBC doesn&rsquo;t have the &ldquo;cult&rdquo; stigma that, for many, the IFB movement does.</li><br />
</ul><br />
So despite being a fan and friend of many southern Baptists&nbsp;and recognizing that there are real benefits to being in the SBC,<strong> I could not, in good conscience be a participating member of the SBC.</strong></p>
<p>Let me tell you five reasons why:</p>
<h2>1. Their music is off the rails.</h2><br />
I don&rsquo;t take the most conservative music position of any independent Baptist I know - not even close. We sing songs in our church written by Keith and Kristen Getty (and others like them), I wouldn&rsquo;t condemn a church just for using four singers with mics rather than a choir and when I listen to music for enjoyment (which is rare) it&rsquo;s usually something like Steve Green. So no one is going to have any luck prosecuting me for being Mr. Music Nazi.</p>
<p>Even so, looking at much of the music in the SBC just turns my stomach. I&rsquo;m sorry, but how can you have a rock band (often dressed like a rock band) on the same stage as sound teaching? I realize I&rsquo;m alienating people here, but it is a big problem for me. How can you have a &ldquo;look how much like paganism we can be&rdquo; exposition followed by an expository sermon? Call me a grumpy fundy, but it just doesn&rsquo;t compute.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve personally witnessed SCB youth groups do all manner of nasty things and moments later be caught up in ecstasy of &ldquo;worship&rdquo; with their hands waving in the air.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just something in the youth room. This is pervasive. As far as I can tell, it&rsquo;s all over the SBC. Even in very conservative places like Al Mohler&rsquo;s Seminary.<br />
To me - that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<h2>2. They allow many dominant church growth style pastors who are borderline heretical.</h2><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Ed_and_lisa_young.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2093" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Ed_and_lisa_young-300x199.jpg" alt="Ed_and_lisa_young" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>Rick Warren recently called the pope &ldquo;Holy Father&rdquo;, Ed Young lay in a bed with his wife on the roof of their church to promote his deep treatise &ldquo;sexperiment&rdquo;, Perry Noble used expletives to describe the people in his church looking for doctrine, Steven Furtick is&hellip;well&hellip; Steven Furtick.</p>
<p>What do all of those guys have in common? They are all members of the SCB in good standing. In fact, Warren was the keynote speaker at last years convention. Noble pastors the largest church in the SBC. These guys are SCB royalty. They are also either borderline or full blown heretics.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not to say there are no IFB heretics. There are. But we have no official way to censor them. We are independent. The SBC, on the other hand, can. They can kick them out. They can formally censor them.</p>
<p>Instead they celebrate them. I have a problem with that.</p>
<h2>3. They still have major doctrinal problems in higher ed.</h2><br />
SBC education has come a long way from the 70s. Read Albert Mohler&rsquo;s inspiring &ldquo;The Conviction to Lead&rdquo; to hear the story of what Southern Seminary was like then and what Southern Seminary is like now. But Southern Seminary is not the only SBC school. There are many of them and many of them where liberal faculty still.</p>
<p>To it&rsquo;s credit, the leadership of the SBC is working on changing that. But progress is slow, and SBC monies are still going to colleges with liberal professors.</p>
<h2>4. Their leaders do some questionable things in the name of political action.</h2><br />
Recently, <a href="http://www.onenewsnow.com/church/2014/10/30/where-are-southern-baptist-leaders-headed-re-homosexuality#.VJLo3orF-Qz">I saw news I couldn&rsquo;t believe</a>. Albert Mohler (whose stance on homosexuality is incontrovertible) gave a speech to a gay lobby where he apologized to the gay community from the Christianity. Among other questionable things that Mohler apologized for was &ldquo;denying sexual orientation.&rdquo; Now, putting aside the fact that Mohler has no business apologizing for me or any other Christian, I have a real problem with that.</p>
<p>In another bit of news, Russell Moore, the president of the Southern Baptists&rsquo; Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, has been on a stir lately. Recently, he visited the vatican. Later, he defended the pope and questioned the difference between the Pope&rsquo;s gospel and his. He&rsquo;s been all over the Ferguson thing pushing for &ldquo;racial reconciliation&rdquo; and he has been a vocal advocate of illegal immigration. He&rsquo;s doing all of this as the head of the official ethics branch of the SBC.</p>
<h2>5. Their publishing wing (Lifeway) sells and even publishes heretics.</h2><br />
Anytime you go into a Lifeway Christian bookstore (they are all over the South) you are in an official wing of the Southern Baptist Convention. Lifeway publishes the books of Beth Moore, Perry Noble, Steven Furtick and Rick Warren. Walking through a Lifeway store you&rsquo;ll see books promoted by people charismatics like TD Jakes, Sarah Young (Jesus Calling), John Hagee. You&rsquo;ll find books about going to heaven and back like 90 Minutes in Heaven and Heaven is for Real. (You can read more <a href="http://pulpitandpen.org/2014/12/08/lifeway-exec-says-pastors-not-taking-annual-raises-hurts-their-church-while-he-sells-jesus-calling/">here</a>.)</p>
<h2>Conclusion.</h2><br />
What&rsquo;s my point in writing this? It&rsquo;s not to point fingers and muckrake and it&rsquo;s not to excuse the problems that we have in the IFB movement. It&rsquo;s just to say this: There was a good reason many of our independent Baptist forbears left the conventions and there are still good reasons to stay out of them. I would never ostracize someone merely for being a member of the SBC (neither did John R. Rice, Jack Hyles, Lee Roberson and others of their generation who had far more first hand knowledge of the problems within the SBC than I do) nor would I deny that there are many wonderful, well-meaning and faithful Christians within the convention.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m glad I pastor an independent church.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that if we support a missionary that is doing questionable things. We can investigate and drop them. I&rsquo;m glad that if some famous independent Baptist pastor starts doing questionable things, we can just stop having anything to do with them. I&rsquo;m glad that there is really nothing to tying me to other independent Baptists who I think are errant or heretical other than a two words on a church sign that are both adjectives and not official affiliations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m an independent Baptist. And when I look over the fence at other groups, which I don&rsquo;t do too often, I find much to confirm that.</p>
