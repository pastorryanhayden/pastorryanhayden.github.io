<p>Hopefully, this post will be what few of my posts actually are: non-controversial.</p>
<h3>Film making</h3><br />
We've started making announcement videos and I'm the guy behind the camera. This is actually something I've wanted to do for years but never had the opportunity. Currently, we are using our churches DSLR camera and iMovie.<br />

<h3>Facebook advertising</h3><br />
Facebook boasts over 40,000 active users within driving distance of our church. (There are only about 60,000 people. Factor in children and the elderly and that's a huge number.) If you do it right - if you limit who you advertise to and pay for ads per click (rather than impressions) you can get an ad for your church in front of tons of people for pennies. Last week, our ad got on 1500 Facebook timelines and costs $5. Contrast that with a newspaper ad, which probably wouldn't even get seen and would cost $50-100 and you can see why I'm psyched about Facebook ads.</p>

<h3>Juicing</h3><br />
No - not in the A-Rod sense. Someone gave me a juicer and after making fun of it for awhile, I tried making my own juice. I find that it gives me an energy boost and helps me concentrate. The downside - it costs ten times as much as coffee. Right now it's couple times a week thing.</p>
<h3>Twitter</h3><br />
I've had a twitter account for years, but never spent any time on it. Recently, I've gotten into Twitter and enjoy the interaction with preachers. Twitter for me is like Facebook where the only people on it are other preachers. Sometimes, it gets annoying but I'm still sucked in.</p>
<h3>Reading chapter books to my kids</h3><br />
My oldest daughter got an Amelia Bedelia chapter book from a relative for Christmas and she loved having it read to her. It's kicked off a nightly tradition of reading chapter books to my 3 and 4 year old daughters. So far we've read Charlottes Web and an American Girl book.</p>

<h3>Audible</h3><br />
A few months ago I got snookered into a free trial of audible. It ain't free no more - but I really like having audio books to listen to while doing menial tasks like painting or cleaning, so its probably here to stay.</p>

<h3>Evangelistic expository preaching</h3><br />
I've made a commitment this year to emphasize evangelistic preaching on Sunday mornings. I'm trying to purposely choose evangelistic texts on a regular basis and adding an evangelistic thrust to all my Sunday morning messages. &nbsp;So far, I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Show-Preach-Evangelistic-Sermons-Series/dp/0825438802/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390074365&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Evangelistic+preaching">Show Me How To Preach Expository Evangelistic Messages</a> by R. Larry Moyer. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Preparing-Evangelistic-Sermons-Seven-Step-Preaching-ebook/dp/B006NYFW32/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390074365&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Evangelistic+preaching">Preparing Evangelistic Sermons</a> by Ramesh Richard &nbsp;and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Physicians-Souls-Peter-Masters-ebook/dp/B007I6MFFM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390074467&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=physician+of+souls+peter+masters">Physicians of Souls</a> by Peter Masters.</p>
<h3>Beef stew</h3><br />
Really. It takes me ten minutes to make from scratch and put in a crock pot and is a great meal for Sunday Afternoon or Wednesday night. Plus, it's got about the manliest name ever.</p>
<h3>Podcasting</h3><br />
I've started writing and producing a one minute daily devotional podcast called<a href="http://www.biblebaptistmattoon.org/minutewithjesus/"> "A Minute With Jesus."</a> Surprisingly, I've found the whole process to be enjoyable and am glad I'm doing it. It's been really exciting to have church members tell me they listen and are pushing their friends and coworkers to listen.</p>

<h3>Real racing 3</h3><br />
I'm not a video game guy. I usually have a game or two on my phone, but can measure the amount of time i spend on them every month in seconds, not minutes. I mercilessly teased my wife for her candy crush addiction. (Glad that's over.)</p>
<p>Real Racing is the first game I've played in a long time that I've gotten in to. Try it out, but I warn you, you might get hooked too.</p>
