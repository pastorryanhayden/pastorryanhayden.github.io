<p><em>Illinois is currently pushing a very aggressive gay marriage bill through its legislature. &nbsp;While I don't want to jump into controversy, and don't want to be guilty of "hating" my rights to preach the Bible unimpeded could be threatened by this bill. &nbsp;If you are a Christian living in Illinois, I highly&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;you familiarize yourself with this bill, that you flood your congressman's office with mail and emails, and that you think about writing a letter in your local paper.&nbsp;</em> They won't stop at this. The same people who pushed for civil unions in 2011 are now suing the state and saying those civil unions are unconstitutional. The same politicians who pushed the Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act into law are now sponsoring the Religious Liberty and Marriage Fairness Act. The mere right to a civil union was never their agenda, nor is the right to marry. Almost immediately after the Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act was passed a homosexual couple was filing suit against a Christian bed and breakfast owner because he, on religious grounds, refused to rent his facility for a homosexual ceremony. Not long after that, the state pushed Catholic Charities out of foster care work because Catholic Charities refused, for religious reasons, to place children in homosexual homes. Naming the new bill "The Religious Liberty and Marriage Equality Act" is a pretty thin ruse. It will immediately be used as ammunition against those who hold religious convictions contrary to the homosexual agenda. The tolerance movement is very intolerant of traditional religion. They aren't looking for the right to cohabit or the right to marry so much as the right to demonize and marginalize those who disagree with them. They very much want to push to the back of the bus anybody who dares to say their lifestyle is anything less than natural, healthy, and beautiful. "Marriage Fairness" may be the greatest threat to "Religious Liberty" our state will ever face.</p></p>
