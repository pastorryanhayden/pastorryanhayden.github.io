<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><em><strong>I used to be all about church bulletins.</strong></em> For several years, and in different churches, the church bulletin was my responsibility. For awhile we did the typical bi-fold church bulletin with a color photo on the cover before I settled on what I thought was the Holy Grail of church bulletins, a legal sized tri-fold. The bulletins looked great, had a ton of information, and even a place for a "pastors pen" and a sermon notes. <del>I'm pretty sure you can still find blog posts about that bulletin style in the archives.</del>&nbsp;(It was on an older iteration of this blog that got wiped out in the blogcopalypse.)</span></p>
<p>The tri-fold and bi-fold bulletins looked great and had a lot of information,<em> but they were also a lot of work</em>. <strong>Hours</strong> of work each week: Whenever I needed to promote something in the church, I would have to make several graphics. I had to think about what was going to be on the cover each week. &nbsp;On top of the work, I was spending a lot of church money on paper and toner.</p>
<p>Slowly it began to dawn on me that what the people who sat in our church want most out of the bulletin is <strong>information about what was coming up in the immediate future</strong>. So I began to think about it and this format is what I've settled on:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1512" align="alignnone" width="500"]<a class="fancybox" title="Front of Bulletin" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/12-15-front.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1512" alt="Front of Bulletin" src="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/12-15-front.jpg" width="500" height="766" /></a> Front of Bulletin[/caption]</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1513" align="alignnone" width="500"]<a class="fancybox" title="Back of bulletin" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/12-15-back.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1513" alt="Back of bulletin" src="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/12-15-back.jpg" width="500" height="740" /></a> Back of bulletin[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let me lay out the benefits of doing the bulletin this way:</p>
<h2>It saves money.</h2><br />
When we switched the bulletin to this format, we went from buying specialty legal paper and using a sheet of it per bulletin to using only half of a regular letter sized piece of paper per bulletin. We cut the print numbers on our printer by more than 50%. It's not an exaggeration to say that doing the bulletin this way cut down the bulletin costs by 75%. It turned something that used to take up a majority of our office supplies budget into something that is a very minor expense.</p>
<h2>It saves time.</h2><br />
I used to spend about two yours a week on the bulletin. Now, I'd probably estimate that I spend between ten and twenty minutes. The bulletin is now something that I can do on a Saturday night or Sunday morning without raising my stress level at all.</p>
<h2>We design one graphic for promotion.</h2><br />
In the promotion section on the back, the graphics are all 16x9. That's not accidental. Basically, they are holders for Powerpoint slides. I make one Powerpoint (actually Keynote) slide, save it as an image, put it in that placeholder, and give it a brief description. Not only does this save me time, but it makes the presentation of the event more consistent.</p>
<h2>The information our people most want is laid out in a clear, consistent and, and familiar format.</h2><br />
I designed the bulletin to mirror the look of a weekly calendar. Because of this, it needs no explanation. People pick it up and they know exactly what it is for.</p>
<h2>We can use "consumer" software.</h2><br />
I used to use Adobe InDesign for our bulletin, now we use Apple's Pages. To borrow a phrase I read yesterday on another blog - "it's free on a mac and costs $599 on Windows, but it comes with a free Mac Mini." That's been another huge money saver, as I've been able to cut out my Adobe Creative Cloud subscription (which I was paying for) and do most of our promotion using free tools. Is it as good as InDesign? Not even close. But it works, and it doesn't cost me $50 a month.</p>
<h2>We can share the bulletin with others online for editing.</h2><br />
One benefit of using pages is that I can work on the bulletin with my iPad or iPhone (though I don't do this very often) and I can share it with church members, no matter what kind of computer they have, via iWork.com, so that they can edit it. This comes in handy when I'm on vacation and have my computer with me.</p>
<h2>Exactly no one has complained about the transition.</h2><br />
We've been doing this for months and I've yet to hear anybody say "Pastor, we miss the old bulletins with the pretty pictures." &nbsp;In fact, it seems like people like the new design better.</p>
<p><strong>I realize this style of bulletin isn't for everybody, but if you'd like to adapt this for your church, you can find a Pages file for one of our bulletins as well as a PDF below:</strong></p>
