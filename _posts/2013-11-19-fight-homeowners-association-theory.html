<p><em>This post is the third part of a series: Why We Fight: A Defense of Pushing for IFB Reform. &nbsp;You might want to <a title="Why We Fight: A Defense of Pushing for IFB Reform." href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/fight-defense-pushing-ifb-reform/">check out the introduction</a> and <a title="Why We Fight: More, Not Less." href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/fight-less/">the first post</a> to get you caught up.</em></p>
<p>Imagine buying a house and moving in to a new neighborhood. All of the houses are new. They have well manicured lawns, picket fences and new siding. The houses aren't spectacular or ritzy, but they are all nice and people are excited about moving in to the new neighborhood.</p>
<p>Imagine living in that new house for a year or so. You take care of your yard. You keep up your house. You pick up trash along the side of the road. You have a sense of pride about the house you own and the neighborhood you live in. Now imagine that three new people move in on your street. These new people almost never mow their lawn. They put old cars on cinderblocks in their driveways and their front porches look like like a cross between the dump, Toys R. Us, and Nagasaki. Very quickly, your street goes from being a respectable new neighborhood that people are proud to move into to a questionable neighborhood that people don't let their kids walk through unsupervised. The appraiser tells you that the property value of your house has dropped. What do you do?</p>
<p>I'm no fan of homeowners associations, but I understand why they exist. If you were in the situation above, you'd want some resource for setting enforceable standards for your neighborhood.</p>
<p>Young independent Baptist pastors have chosen to minister in the IFB "neighborhood." We've gone to independent Baptist colleges, taken our licks working in independent Baptist ministries, and have chosen to pastor in independent Baptist churches. We've taken unpopular positions (like dispensationalism, ecclesiastical separation and King James Onlyism.) We've bought our house and committed to the neighborhood.</p>
<p>But whenever our IFB neighbors forsake biblical ministry methods and do questionable things, things that undermine the testimony of the independent Baptist neighborhood, we are told to shut up and mind our own business. We hear things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Just focus on mowing your own lawn."</li>
<li>"You haven't lived here long enough to deal with neighborhood problems."</li>
<li>"You're yards kind of small, how dare you question that guy with a bigger yard."</li>
<li>"How dare you mention Joe's house, it used to be the nicest in the neighborhood."</li><br />
</ul><br />
But none of those things change the fact that the bad practices of others are hurting our neighborhood.</p>
<p>We are not denominational. There is no Independent Baptist homeowner's association. There is no official recourse for dealing with people tearing up the neighborhood. Like it or not, however, in the eyes of an increasingly connected world, we are tied together in association just by having the same subtitle on our church sign. We might be as as diverse as the balls in a gum ball machine, but in the eyes of outsiders, we are all in the same glass globe. We are one.</p>
<p>So why do we fight? <strong>Because fighting against the unbiblical practices of our fellow independent Baptists is one of the only ways we have keeping the neighborhood up.</strong></p>
<p>(By the way: let me be clear - we are fighting against practices and ideas, not against people. To use the already overused analogy - we are not trying to kick people out of the neighborhood, we are trying to get them to mow their yard.)</p>
<p>In truth, no one believes that we can keep people who practice unbiblical ministry out of independent Baptist churches. We can't kick them out of the neighborhood. We can, however, let them know that they are effecting our testimony, that we don't appreciate it, and that if they don't change, they aren't welcome in our fellowship. &nbsp;We can clearly state our expectations of biblical ministry, and we can help, educate and (if need be) separate from those who don't meet the expectations.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'm going to give the third reason we fight, it has something to do with Bambi and Jaws.</p>
