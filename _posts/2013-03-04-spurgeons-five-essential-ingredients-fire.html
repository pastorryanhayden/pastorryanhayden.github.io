<p>This post is part of a series on Spurgeon&rsquo;s necessary ingredients for every preacher. It is taken from a lecture of Spurgeon&rsquo;s entitled<strong> &ldquo;Light, Fire, Faith, Life, Love&rdquo;</strong> which can be found in the book <em>&ldquo;An All Around Ministry.&rdquo; &nbsp;</em>This lecture is one of the most helpful and memorable things I've ever read about preaching and preachers.&nbsp;In each of these posts, I am trying to pull out highlights from Spurgeon and apply them to today. Here are the previous posts:</p>

As always, I highly recommend you read <a href="http://www.spurgeon.org/misc/aarm06.htm">the source</a>. It&rsquo;s well worth your time.</p>

<p>Today, we are going to look at ingredient number 2:</p>
<h1 id="fire">Fire</h1><br />

<h2 id="firegetsabadrap.">Fire get&rsquo;s a bad rap.</h2><br />
In the beginning of this section, Spurgeon deals with the obvious objection to talking about fire. Those whose fire is fake. (He makes a veiled reference to the Salvation Army.) But quickly comes back to say that it&rsquo;s a much better thing to be on fire in our ministries than to be cold.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;None of the supposed evils of fire are equal to those of lukewarmness.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
<h2 id="fireispreferredoverlukewarmness.">Fire is preferred over lukewarmness.</h2><br />
Spurgeon made the point that many, many pulpits are lukewarm and do nothing to excite anybody. Concluding that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A lukewarm sermon sickens every healthy mind.&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
Then he went on saying that we need fire in our churches as well as our pulpits which will not happen without fire in the preacher.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May God grant us grace to go to extremes in His service! May we be filled with an unrestrainable zeal for His glory! May the Lord answer us by fire, and may that fire fall first on the ministers, and then upon the people!&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
<h2 id="thelightofoursermonsmustgiveoffheat.">The light of our sermons must give off heat.</h2><br />
A sermon must not just be orderly and true, there also must be some &ldquo;fire&rdquo; to it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So have I known ministers, whose light was destitute of heat; and, consequently, the poor sticks around them have never kindled into a flame, nor have frozen hearts been melted by their influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;but I am sure that, as a matter of fact, energy is the main thing in the human side of preaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brethren, speak because you believe the gospel of Jesus, speak because you feel its power, speak under the influence of the truth which you are delivering, speak with the Holy Ghost sent down from Heaven, and the result will not be doubtful.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
<h2 id="firemustcomefromgod.">Fire must come from God.</h2></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let it be carefully remembered that our flame must be kindled from on high. Nothing is more to be despised than a mere painted fire, the simulation of earnestness. Sooner let us have an honest death than a counterfeit life. The imitation of Baxter is detestable; but to be like Baxter is seraphic. If you would be like Whitefield, I would say be Whitefield. Let the fire be kindled by the Holy Ghost, and not by animal passion, the desire of honor, emulation of others, or the excitement of attending meetings. Let the terrible example of Nadab and Abihu for ever put away strange fire from our censers. Burn because you have been in solemn fellowship with the Lord our God.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
<h1 id="firewillconsumeus.">Fire will consume us.</h1><br />
Spurgeon concluded this section by saying that if a preacher really has fire, it will cost him something and consume him totally.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Herod was eaten of worms, being cursed of God; but to be consumed by God for His own service, is to be blessed to the full. We have a choice between these two, to be eaten up by our corruptions, or by the zeal of God&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
<h1 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h1><br />
Personally, I know that I need fire in my ministry. I have spent the last couple of weeks trying to rely upon God and begging His power in the pulpit. I tend to the cold and methodical, may the Lord help me.</p>
<p>But I also know, as Spurgeon alluded to, that there are many who have a kind of fire that isn&rsquo;t. There are many in &ldquo;a simulation of earnestness.&rdquo; Fire has become institutionalized today, and become an end in itself. Heat without light is just as useless as light without heat.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, just because others are abusing an idea, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it isn&rsquo;t scriptural and can be totally ignored. I need fire in my ministry.</p>
