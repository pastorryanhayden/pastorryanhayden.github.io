<p><strong>We independent Baptists have a word problem.</strong> We have a long history of taking words, ripping them from their broader context (whether their context in scripture or context in modern culture) and assinging to them a whole new meaning. Words like <a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/preach-sermon-landmarks/">landmark</a>, <a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/whats-the-matter-with-contemporary/">contemporary</a>, <a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/defining-terms/">liberal</a>, <a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/defining-terms/">evangelical</a>, <a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/im-old-paths/">old paths</a>, and many others mean something totally different to an independent baptist than they do to everyone else or than they did in the Bible. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many time&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve had to resist the urge to say, in my best Inigo Montoya voice, &ldquo;you keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One word I think we&rsquo;ve totally ruined is &ldquo;modesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s make one thing clear - this post will not be a defense of mini-skirts or bikinis. There is a strong biblical case to be made against dressing to draw attention to your sexuality. I just don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;modest&rdquo; is the best word for that cause.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that modesty doesn&rsquo;t include covering ourselves up - it does - it&rsquo;s just that equating modesty to hem length is like using the word &ldquo;ocean&rdquo; to refer to saltwater. Modesty is not less than covering up, but it is much, much more and we&rsquo;ve lost the greater meaning of it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get biblical:</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;modest&rdquo; is found a grand total of once in scripture. In 1 Timothy 2:9</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest&nbsp;apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
The word from which modest is translated &ldquo;kosmios&rdquo; is found in only one other place in scripture, also in 2 Timothy:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour,&nbsp;given to hospitality, apt to teach;&rdquo;</em> (1 Timothy 3:2)</blockquote><br />
In that verse, it&rsquo;s translated &ldquo;of good behavior.&rdquo; So what does &ldquo;modest&rdquo; mean?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G2887&amp;t=KJV">Strong&rsquo;s Dictionary</a> defines the word as:</p>
<blockquote><p>well arranged, seemly, modest.</blockquote><br />
Vines adds</p>
<blockquote><p>&rdquo;orderly, well-arranged, decent, modest" (akin to kosmos, in its primary sense as "harmonious arrangement, adornment;&rdquo;)&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
Webster&rsquo;s 1828 dictionary says</p>
<blockquote><p>&rdquo;1. Properly, restrained by a sense of propriety; hence, not forward or bold; not presumptuous or arrogant; not boastful; 2. Not bold or forward; 3. Not loose; not lewd. 4. Moderate; not excessive or extreme; not extravagant;&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
It doesn&rsquo;t seem that the primary meaning of modesty speaks to sexuality. It seems that the primary meaning of modesty speaks to decency and orderliness. When you take that meaning of modest back to this verse and consider the rest of it (the prohibitions against braided hair, gold, pearls and costly array), it seems like Paul was saying <strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t objectify yourself, don&rsquo;t draw attention to yourself.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>You can do that in a loose fitting long dress.</p>
<p>Our town only has one church that even comes close to being a &ldquo;mega-church.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a large Apostolic congregation. In Mattoon, you can spot an apostolic woman from miles away by their long hair, long dresses, and the long time they obviously spent in front of a mirror. Sunday night at Cracker Barrel is like a dress up competition. Rhinestones, ruffles and rouge quickly filling every corner.</p>
<p>These ladies would fit in fine at every Bible College I&rsquo;ve been to. They&rsquo;d certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be breaking the dress code. <strong>Yet I submit that the way they dress is the exact opposite of modesty. </strong> They may not be saying &ldquo;look at my curves&rdquo; or &ldquo;look at my skin&rdquo; but they are still saying &ldquo;look at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even need flashy clothes to do that, you just have to be trying to stand out. I personally think culottes can be immodest. Not because they draw attention to sexuality or because I&rsquo;m that strong on gender destinction (they don&rsquo;t and I&rsquo;m not) but because in the world we live in, they scream &ldquo;look at me,&rdquo; &ldquo;look how modest I am,&rdquo; which is, in fact, a form of immodesty. (Anything that screams &ldquo;look at me&rdquo; is a form of objectification, whether it is objectification for the cause of sex or objectification for the cause of a sub-culture.)</p>
<p>Nor do you need to be a woman to be immodest. Pastors are supposed to be modest (although it doesn&rsquo;t mention modesty of apparel.) Our lives should be ordered in such a way that does&rsquo;t scream for attention.</p>
<p>So what am I getting at? Let me tell you what I&rsquo;m not getting at:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m not saying we should lower our dress standards.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s ok for women (or men) to dress in a way that draws attention to themselves sexually or otherwise.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not saying we should imitate the world.</li><br />
</ul><br />
I am saying that we should stop equating modesty to the length of a woman&rsquo;s hem or the looseness of their blouse because it&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>I am saying that we should rescue 1 Timothy 2:9 from those who have whittled it down to one word (modest) and redefined that word.</p>
<p>I am saying that the best use of scripture in every case is to use it as God intended and that God intended a much bigger, and much deeper, meaning for the word &ldquo;modest&rdquo; than we&rsquo;ve let it come to mean.</p>
