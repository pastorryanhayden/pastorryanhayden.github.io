<p>This week, I'm posting the beliefs that I hold that, even if I wanted to be a mainstream evangelical, would keep me from being accepted. These aren't so much the distinctives of being an Independent Fundamental Baptist. But they're close. &nbsp;You can read the <a title="Reasons I Could Never Be Mainline" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/reasons-i-could-never-be-mainline/">introduction here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ibelievethatbothecclesiasticalandpersonalseparationaretaughtendevenemphasizedinthent.">1. I believe that both ecclesiastical and personal separation are taught and even emphasized in the NT.</h2><br />
<a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/separation.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-847" alt="separation" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/03/separation-300x150.jpg" width="300" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>Ecclesiastical separation, the separation of individuals and churches from professing Christians who espouse false doctrine, is very clearly commanded in the New Testament. <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Romans16%3A17" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Romans 16:17</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/2Thessalonians3%3A16" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a> says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
2 John adds</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
Separating myself and my church from those who espouse unscriptural error is not an act of pride or contention, it is obedience to the clear commands of the New Testament.</p>

<p>I also believe in personal separation, that Christians are supposed to be separate from the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians6%3A14" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 6:14</a> says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers:for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
Then later on in verse 17&ndash;18 it says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
In another place it says that Christians are to be a <em>&ldquo;peculiar people.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>These doctrines (particularly the first one) are what make fundamentalists fundamentalists (the term is flawed, but it&rsquo;s what has been given to us.) The vast majority of those outside of fundamentalism are not consistently practicing any kind of ecclesiastical separation. There are a few who do it sporadicly, but they do not do it consistently.</p>
<p>Also, the majority of those outside of fundamentalism have all but ignored the idea of personal separation from the world. While I personally take issue with the way &ldquo;standards of separation&rdquo; have been emphasized in independent Baptist churches, I don&rsquo;t think we need to swing to the other side of the pendulum and just about ignore the concept of personal separation altogether.</p>
