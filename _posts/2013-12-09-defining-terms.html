<p>In recent days, I've read several instances where fundamentalists pastors were criticized using words like <strong>liberal</strong>, <strong>neo-evangelical</strong>, and <strong>emergent church</strong>. Also, I've heard these terms thrown about for a long time in lots of sermons. I thought it might be helpful to these critics to offer a definition of these terms:</p>
<h2>Liberal</h2><br />
"Liberal", in the theological sense, refers to a theological movement that rejects the Bible as inerrant and authoritative. It gives equal credibility, or even greater credibility, to science and secular academic advances. According to fundamental historian David Beale, there have been three schools of thought in liberalism: modernism, neo-liberalism, and neo-orthodoxy. Modernism outright rejected the supernatural elements of the Bible. Neo-liberalism was an attempt to promote modernism while couching it in more theologically conservative terms. The third form of theological liberalism, neo-orthodoxy, is actually a return to protestant orthodoxy, but one that uses deliberately squishy language anywhere where it may disagree with modern science, opening up the possibility of having outwardly devout people with their feet in both secular and traditionally biblical ponds. &nbsp;(Great books on liberalism include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentalism-American-Culture-George-Marsden-ebook/dp/B000SFOSR8/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1386625180&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fundamentalism+and+american+culture">"Fundamentalism and American Culture"</a> by George Marsden, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pursuit-Purity-Soft-David-Beale/dp/0890843503/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1386625063&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=David+Beale">"In Pursuit of Purity"</a> by David Beale and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Christianity-Liberalism-J-Gresham-Machen-ebook/dp/B005Y4F336/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1386625216&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Christianity+and+liberalism">"Christianity and Liberalism"</a> by J. Gresham Machen)</p>
<h2>Neo-evangelical</h2><br />
"Neo-evangelical" or "new evangelical" is a term given to a group of evangelicals from the late 1940s through 1960s who wanted to distance themselves from fundamentalists. <em>Why not just use the term "evangelical?"</em> Because at the time, evangelical and fundamentalist were generally two terms for the same group of people. Neo-evangelicals, though technically orthodox, rejected the anti-intellectualism and politics of traditional fundamentalists and evangelicals and sought to dialogue with liberals and secular academics. Neo-evangelicals had three basic centers of power: Fuller Seminary in California, <em>Christianity Today</em> magazine, and Billy Graham. Most conservative evangelicals today would say that neo-evangelicalism as a movement was a bad idea and have come to reject most of its tenets. &nbsp;(For a thorough discussion of Neo-evangelicalism, you can read George Marsden's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reforming-Fundamentalism-Fuller-Seminary-Evangelicalism/dp/0802808700/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1386625001&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=reforming+fundamentalism+fuller+seminary+and+the+new+evangelicalism"><em>"Reforming Fundamentalism"</em></a>)</p>
<h2>The Emergent Church</h2><br />
The Emergent Church refers to a group of people who came into prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Basically, the emergent church was an attempt to unite Christianity and post-modernism. While a liberal would look at the Bible and say "that's not true, science proves it wrong" a post-modernist would look at the Bible and say "there is no truth, only what you make of it." Most of the Emergent Church leaders focus on denying things like the existence of hell, the exclusivity of the gospel, and on various leftist political agendas. The recognized leaders of the emergent church movement have been Brian McClaren and Rob Bell. &nbsp;(<em>By the way, if you want a great discussion of the emergent church and what it is not, check out this week's <a href="http://www.ministryconnectionpodcast.com/the-emergent-church-and-young-fundamentalism-tmc013/">episode of the Ministry Connection Podcast</a>.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>While there may very well be IFB pastors drifting in one of those directions, I certainly don't know of any.</strong> Most, if not all, IFB pastors are committed to the authority of Scripture. Some of these men being criticized actually seem to have a higher view of scripture than their critics. <em>IFB pastors are being called these things for doing things like using a screen in their church service, occasionally not wearing a tie, following certain pastors in the reformed evangelical or church growth camps, drawing a slightly different standard of music than their forbears and similar slight changes from pastors a generation or two before.</em></p>
<p><strong>While each one of those things <em>may</em> be wrong, none of them qualifies someone to be called a neo-evangelical, a liberal, or emerging</strong>. To use that language in reaction to the above changes is sloppy at best, and most likely outright mean and dishonest. How much better would it be to deal with each issue thoroughly and scripturally rather than using unfair, untrue and partisan labels.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"<a>He is</a> the Rock, his work <a>is</a> perfect: for all his ways <a>are</a> judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right <a>is</a> he."</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Deuteronomy32%3A4" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 32:4</a></blockquote></p>
<h1>Addendum:</h1><br />
Mike Austin on twitter mentioned that the same thing goes for the words "Pharisee" and "legalist."</p>
<p>I want to say, in the spirit of fairness, that these names tend to be thrown around almost as carelessly as those listed above (usually by the opposite crowd as the ones above). The problem with these words is that they are not so clearly defined, but I'll take a crack at it:</p>
<h3>Pharisee</h3><br />
Pharisees were a group who, probably under the ministry of Ezra the priest, made the decision that God's law was going to be their law and they were going to take a stand for righteousness. The name "pharisee" means "the separated ones." They were zealous defenders of the law and were theological heroes. They showed their patriotism in leading the Macheabean revolt and their determination in refusing the advances of the greeks and romans. Hundreds of them were crucified for their stand by the Romans.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Pharisees became so obsessed with the observance of the law, that by the time Christ came around, they had reduced it to a bunch of external rules, and kept adding more and more rules to keep people from possibly disobeying it. They were the original "let's not dance near the line people." The problems with that were two-fold, 1) they put heavy burdens on people that God didn't intend them to bear and 2) they made themselves (or their favorite preacher) the law. Despite their stand for truth, their moral purity, and their storied heritage they were the biggest villains in Christ's ministry.</p>
<p>While I don't like to call people Pharisee (I try not to call people names at all) I do think there are quite a few fundamental preachers today who struggle with the same shortcomings as the pharisees, and I think a thorough study of the Pharisees would do any preacher good. If nothing else, they stand as a good case study for the potential pitfalls of those committed to the truth and to moral purity.</p>
<h3>Legalist</h3><br />
The word "legalist" is a harder word to define. There are two contradictory definitions of the word. One group says that the only legalists are those who believe that they can work their way to heaven by the keeping of the law and good works. Those who want to add works to salvation. The other group says that legalists are those who believe that our sanctification is to happen through our effort and keeping of the law. The second group wants to describe anyone they think focuses on law too much as a legalist.</p>
<p>The first group insists that their definition is rock solid and biblical, and yet the word "legalist" doesn't even appear in the KJV, never mind get a definition.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm not of the opinion that the term "legalist" should only refer to salvation because I do see a danger, both in scripture and through experience in over-emphasizing the place of law and rule in the Christian life. Nevertheless, because of the confusion in terms, I try to avoid calling people a "legalist".</p>
<p>Despite the ambiguity of these terms when compared with the terms from yesterday, I still think that we should be very careful when we use them. I don't think we should apply them to large swaths of preachers and especially think it's a dangerous habit to use the terms for anybody who holds to a high moral standard that we do not.</p>
