<p>Dear Noah,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re finally here. You came into the world at 11:45 PM last night, Central time, which will probably cause confusion with your mostly east coast relatives about your birthday for years to come. (It&rsquo;s March 7, by the way.) You&rsquo;re a big kid, much bigger than either of your sisters and you have my long toes and fingers. We&rsquo;re super excited to have you with us. Your sisters are going to go crazy when they see you today.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Photo-Mar-08-9-00-51-AM2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-893" alt="Photo Mar 08, 9 00 51 AM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/03/Photo-Mar-08-9-00-51-AM2-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I wanted to write a little about your name. Preachers (and you&rsquo;ll find out soon enough, that&rsquo;s what I am) have a longstanding tradition of giving their kids names that mean something. We could have gone the Hosea route, and named you Loruhamah or Loammi, but we chose to name you Noah Isaac instead.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why.</p>
<h2 id="noah">Noah</h2><br />
We live in a world that is rapidly turning against God. We&rsquo;ve seen more changes in our society in the last five years than I ever imagined we would. The world we live in now is not the world your Mom and I were born into, and this is the only world that you will ever know.</p>
<p>A long time ago, there lived a man named Noah who, though all the world had turned against God, stood for him and righteousness. He had amazing faith in God that allowed Him to stand firm for 100 years while everyone around him mocked. He was a preacher too, but he never filled a church or won a convert, yet God honored him.</p>
<p>My prayer for you is that you too would become a friend of God, and that you would have the faith to stand by what God&rsquo;s word has said even while the world around you mocks.</p>
<h2 id="isaac">Isaac</h2><br />
I chose Isaac for your middle name because of it&rsquo;s Hebrew meaning. Isaac means &ldquo;he laughs.&rdquo; The greatest pleasure of my entire life so far has been laughing and giggling with your two older sisters (you&rsquo;ll do it to when they&rsquo;re not trying to kill you.)</p>

<p>I never want you to forget that life should be characterized by laughter and joy. The Christian life, should you choose to live it some day, is not a ball and chain. It&rsquo;s a wonderful existence. I hope you find our home to be a happy place where laughter (and coffee) flows freely.</p>
<p>Some day you&rsquo;ll read this (and I&rsquo;ll write some more letters like this) and you&rsquo;ll understand.</p>
<p>Love you son,</p>
<p>Dad.</p>
