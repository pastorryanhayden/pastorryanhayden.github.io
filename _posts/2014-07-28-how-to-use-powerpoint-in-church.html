<p>Last week I had the privilege of presenting a <a title="Grace Conference" href="http://www.graceconference.com/workshops">workshop</a> on ministry tech to a group of pastors and ministry leaders. It was a lot of fun, and it may have opened up some doors for me to do similar training. What it definitely did was force me to create lots of content on ministry tech. I plan on sharing that content on the blog.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start with content about <strong>PowerPoint</strong>.</p>
<p>Before I became a pastor, I was a children&rsquo;s pastor. As a children&rsquo;s pastor, I used PowerPoint every sunday. We sang with PowerPoint, I used Powerpoint for every sermon and we even played PowerPoint review games when the message was over. For children, it was a great tool that helped me keep their attention.</p>
<p>As a senior pastor, I still think PowerPoint is a great tool that aids in people&rsquo;s understanding of the sermon. I&rsquo;m not using it exactly like I did as a kids pastor (We don&rsquo;t play Max the Mouse review games after the invitation) but a lot of the lessons I learned with kids can be adapted and applied to preaching to adults.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using PowerPoint (actually, I use Apple&rsquo;s Keynote, but the same principles apply) for almost a decade. I&rsquo;ve read dozens of PowerPoint related books, prepared hundreds of slide decks, and even given workshops on how to use PowerPoint. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about it, and I want to share some of that with you. I plan on releasing an article about PowerPoint in church every day this week.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a question some of you may be asking?</p>
<h2><em>How would you even use PowerPoint in church?</em></h2><br />
It&rsquo;s a fair question. The answer isn&rsquo;t as obvious as some people might think it is.</p>
<p>Personally, I think there are at least eight&nbsp;good uses for PowerPoint in church:</p>
<h3>1. Use PowerPoint slides for instruction.</h3><br />
Before the service starts, people can look at the screens and get instructions about the service and the church. You can make simple slides with information or requests you may not want to mention every service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your service times.</li>
<li>When the current service will start.</li>
<li>How your church handles nursery.</li>
<li>A request to turn off phones.</li>
<li>Invitation to Sunday School.</li>
<li>Giving goals (i.e. building fund, special missions efforts, etc.)</li>
<li>Information about the church website, podcasts, online sermons, etc.</li><br />
</ul><br />
This allows people to passively take in information before the church service even starts and allows you to focus service time on things that are truly important.</p>

<h3>2. Use PowerPoint slides for promotion.</h3><br />
Every time our church has some kind of church event, I make a slide for it. This slide is usually just some kind of logo or headline placed over a photo. (Brady Shearer from ProChurchTools has a pretty good article - even though I hate the title - about how to make these slides at <a title="Brady Shearer on Graphics" href="http://prochurchtools.com/2-step-foolproof-approach-creating-graphics-dont-suck/">his website.</a>)</p>
<p>When it comes time to give announcements about these events, I simply display that graphic while I&rsquo;m talking about it. The slide gives people a mental picture to put with the announcement.</p>
<p>Another trick I&rsquo;ve learned is to <a title="A Cheaper, Quicker, and Clearer Way To Do Church Bulletins" href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/cheaper-quicker-clearer-way-church-bulletins/">use these slides as graphics in the bulletin</a>. I have my bulletins set up with an upcoming events section, and this section has placeholders for graphics that are the same aspect ratio (in my case 16x9) as my PowerPoint slides. This way I&rsquo;m only taking time to create one graphic and my graphics are consistent.</p>

<h3>3. Use PowerPoint slides to introduce new songs to the church.</h3><br />
On rare occasions, we&rsquo;ll sing a song or chorus in church that isn&rsquo;t in our hymnal. When we do this, instead of printing off handouts for everyone, I&rsquo;ll just put the words on the screen. It puts everyone on the same page.</p>
<h3>4. Use PowerPoint slides as a vehicle for other media.</h3><br />
Sometimes I want to show a video to the church. In our case, most of the time, this is just a collection of photos from some past event (like Vacation Bible School) that is put to music or a missionary introduction video. I&rsquo;ll just drop the video file onto a blank slide and when it&rsquo;s time to play the video, click to that slide with my remote. No more awkward fumbling while waiting for the video to start.</p>
<p>So far, all of these have been uses for PowerPoint during the preservice, song service and announcement times. My favorite uses for PowerPoint slides are actually during the sermon&hellip;</p>
<h3>5. Use PowerPoint slides to display Bible verses.</h3><br />
I usually read a lengthy Bible passage before I preach, and when I do, I simply put the reference on the screen so that people can follow along in their own Bible. I wouldn&rsquo;t put twelve verses on twelve slides and then try to click through them.</p>
<p>What I usually do, however, is put the verse or verses I&rsquo;m focusing on (my text) on a slide, as well as any individual verses that I know I&rsquo;m going to reference throughout my sermon. This enables me to quickly quote the verse and show the verse to the congregation without asking them to turn all over their Bibles and giving them time to get there.</p>

<h3>6. Use PowerPoint slides for clarification and illumination.</h3><br />
A picture is worth 1,000 words.</p>
<p>We are visual creatures. 75% of your brain is dedicated to processing visual information. That&rsquo;s just the way human beings are made. The advent of television and computers has made us even more visual.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1915" align="alignnone" width="298"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/visionchart.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1915 size-medium" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/visionchart-298x300.jpg" alt="Vision chart" width="298" height="300" /></a> Our brains are 75% geared for visual input.[/caption]</p>
<p>Because of this, some things can be greatly clarified with a visual aid.</p>
<p>In his book, <a title="The Back of the Napkin Amazon Link" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Back-Napkin-Expanded-Edition/dp/1591842697"><em>The Back of the Napkin</em></a>, Dan Roam explains how to visualize just about anything with five simple pictures (he gives six but I&rsquo;m skipping the last one.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a <strong>portrait</strong> to help people visualize <strong>what</strong>.</li>
<li>Use a <strong>map</strong> to help people visualize <strong>where</strong>.</li>
<li>Use a <strong>timeline</strong> to help people visualize <strong>when</strong>.</li>
<li>Use a <strong>bar or pie chart</strong> to help people visualize <strong>how much</strong>.</li>
<li>Use a <strong>flowchart</strong> to help people visualize <strong>how</strong>.</li><br />
</ul><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Tech-Workshop.001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1916" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Tech-Workshop.001-300x225.jpg" alt="Tech Workshop.001" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>If you just learn how to use these five pictures, you can help people visualize and understand what you are talking about. These pictures don&rsquo;t have to be complex (actually, simple is better.)</p>
<h3>7. Use PowerPoint slides for location. (To help people follow the sermon.)</h3><br />
Most sermons have some kind of outline. PowerPoint is a great way to help people follow along and to remind people WHERE in the sermon they are at.</p>
<p>Let me give you a simple way to do this.</p>
<h4>Step 1</h4><br />
Make one slide with all of your main points on it and then copy it as many times as you have points. (So if you have four points in your sermon, you end up with four copies of the same slide with your entire outline on it.)</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1917" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1917" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled-300x156.jpg" alt="copies of the outline slide." width="300" height="156" /></a> Copy the outline slide.[/caption]</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4><br />
Starting from the beginning, go through these slides and delete all of the points you haven&rsquo;t come to yet. (So delete points 2-4 on the first slide, 3-4 on the second, 4 on the third.)</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1918" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1918" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled1-300x161.jpg" alt="Delete Points." width="300" height="161" /></a> Delete points to make a progression.[/caption]</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4><br />
Go back through the slides, select all but the point you&rsquo;ll be on, and use opacity to fade back the points you&rsquo;ve already covered by 50%. (So go to the second slide, select point one and fade it back to 50% opacity.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1919" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled2-300x156.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="300" height="156" /></a></p>
<h3>8. Use PowerPoint slides for emphasis.</h3><br />
PowerPoint slides are great for emphasizing a particular thing. Sometimes, if I know I&rsquo;ll be using a quote in a sermon, I&rsquo;ll make a slide for the quote and display the slide while I&rsquo;m saying it. Sometimes, I&rsquo;ll put a verse slide up and underline a particular word or phrase I want to draw people&rsquo;s attention to.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1920" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Climax-Judas-Visitation-training-2.024.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1920" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Climax-Judas-Visitation-training-2.024-300x168.jpg" alt="emphasis example" width="300" height="168" /></a> An example of an emphasis slide.[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>The key to this is to do it sparingly</strong>. As with any use of emphasis, if you try to highlight something all the time, it ceases to really be highlighted.</p>
<p>Have I missed any uses? Do you do something different? Let me know in the comments. In my next post, I&rsquo;ll be posting about things to avoid with PowerPoint in church.</p>
