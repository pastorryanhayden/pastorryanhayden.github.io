<p>Some people are just inspiring. (Even if they are not Christians.) I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from reading about Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, Ben Franklin and Ronald Reagan. Sometimes you learn positive lessons, sometimes you learn negative, but you can almost always learn something.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Oliver" target="_blank">Jamie Oliver</a> is my favorite celebrity. He is not a pastor. I doubt he is a Christian. He&rsquo;s just an eccentric young english chef. But I think he has quite a bit to teach us pastors.</p>
<p>I like to cook and over the years I&rsquo;ve dipped my toe into cooking for a few weeks at a time only to give it up and move onto other things. Nobody has ever made me more excited about cooking than Jamie Oliver. I&rsquo;ve watched his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Oliver's_Food_Revolution" target="_blank">shows</a>, bought his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jamie-Oliver/e/B000APQ8LA/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_3?qid=1359824021&amp;sr=8-3" target="_blank">books</a>, used his <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jamies-recipes/id398011800?mt=8" target="_blank">app</a>, cooked his <a href="http://pinterest.com/rynhayden/recipes-i-m-making/" target="_blank">recipes</a> and the net result is I&rsquo;m more excited about learning to cook now then I was when I first discovered this weird English chef.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/jamie.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-558" alt="jamie" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/jamie-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve followed Jamie Oliver for a while, it dawned on me that <em>Jamie Oliver&rsquo;s lure has nothing to do with cooking, and everything to do with who he is and what he stands for</em> and the more I thought about it, the more I realized that there are principles we can glean from Jamie Oliver that would be super helpful to pastors.</p>
<p>So this week I&rsquo;m going to be posting <strong>&ldquo;Five things Pastors can learn from Jamie Oliver.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>As with my previous post <a title="Making Sense in the Noise Machine.  (My rules for sharing in blogs and social media)" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/making-sense-in-the-noise-machine-my-rules-for-sharing-in-blogs-and-social-media/" target="_blank">series</a>, this page will serve as both the introduction and the table of contents for the posts and I will post every weekday morning.</p>
<p>Here are the principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Things Pastors Could Learn From Jamie Oliver: Be Authentic" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/things-pastors-could-learn-from-jamie-oliver-be-authentic/">Be authentic</a>.</li>
<li>Have a vision and do something about it.</li>
<li>Use fresh ingredients.</li>
<li>Be enthusiastic.</li>
<li>Be generous with your knowledge.</li><br />
</ul><br />
What non-Christian celebrities inspire you?</p>
