<p>I&rsquo;m going to do something a little unorthodox here and post this on my blog.<br />
I&rsquo;m looking for someone to come and help us with our youth ministry. Specifically, I&rsquo;m looking for someone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a clear testimony of salvation.</li>
<li>Is an independent Baptist.</li>
<li>Has been called to the ministry.</li>
<li>Has graduated from&nbsp;Bible college.</li>
<li>Is either married or engaged.</li>
<li>Is willing to start from scratch.</li>
<li>Is willing to work with younger children.</li>
<li>Is willing to be bi-vocational.</li>
<li>Is willing to start on a probational basis.</li><br />
</ul><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot promise much, but I can promise that our church is a great place to minister.</p>
<p>If you are interested, please send your resume to pastorryanhayden@gmail.com. If you know someone you think would be a good fit, please encourage them to send me their resume.</p>
