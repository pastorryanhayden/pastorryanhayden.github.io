<p>I've been doing a lot of reading lately about the religious history of the 1930's through the 1970's and I have to say, much of it isn't pretty. Conservative Christian leaders gave themselves several black eyes during that period, and the two worst were probably the acceptance of antisemitism in its leaders (in the 1930s) and its mishandling of the desegregation crisis of the 1960s.</p></p>
<p>This morning, when I read my newspaper (actually, a digital newspaper called "The Daily" on my iPad) I was shocked to see a video of a young Missouri Pastor (Phil Snyder of Brentwood Christian Church) passionatly making his case before a Springfield, MO city council <strong><em>for</em></strong> gay rights. Basically, he read the anti-desegregation speeches of a bunch of pastors from the middle of the last century and changed the words segregation for gay rights. After he abruptly revealed this ruse, he said "Don't be on the wrong side of history" and steped down from his platform. The video already has over 2 million views on youtube.</p></p>

<p><strong>Phil Snider is dead wrong on this because he is overlooking one truth: the Bible never says it is wrong to be racialy desegregated while the Bible clearly says that homosexuality is a sin.</strong> The preachers he referenced had to use spacious, weak, half-hearted arguments in their defense of segratation because God's word is clearly for racial equality. God's word says in Galatians 3:28 <em>"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."</em> Jesus said he would have <em>"And other sheep I have , which are not of this fold: them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd."</em> Even in the Old Testament, an informed reading of the law shows that the jews were forbidden to be involved in slave trading and commanded to treat strangers (non jews) in the land with respect. Anybody who thinks that the Bible is a racist book just isn't reading it right.</p></p>
<p>Those who think the Bible doesn't say homosexuality is a sin, however, &nbsp;just aren't reading it. Period. Leviticus 18:22 simply says <em>"Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination."</em> 1 Corinthians 6:9 says <em>"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind."</em> Romans 1 makes the case that homosexuality is the ultimate consequence of refusing to retain God in your knowlege. These aren't obscure verses twisted by a bunch of vigilantes in bed sheets to protect a long standing social order. They are clear verses that couldn't be interpreted any other way. In the eyes of an unchanging God, homosexuality was, is, and always will be a sin.</p></p>
<p>Now, that being said, that passage I read in 1 Corinthians decrying homosexuality ends by saying <em>"And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."</em> (1 Corinthians 6:11) Our Lord died to save homosexuals just like he died to save liars and proud men (two things that are also called abominations.) We don't have the right to hate anybody who our Lord died for, rather we need to spend time <em>"In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;"</em> (2 Timothy 2:25) We need to work peacably to see homosexuals saved from their sins.</p></p>
<p>Men who lust after men are sinners, just like men who lust after women who are not their wives are sinners and men who lust after cars and houses God never intended for them to have are sinners. &nbsp;What sinners need is the salvation and repentance that comes from the cross. &nbsp;What they don't need is "preachers" who rush to their defense by taking a pen knife to their bibles then trying to tie anyone who disagrees with them to the unbiblical,&nbsp;erroneous&nbsp;views of a few leaders from our past.</p></p>
