<p>I was reading Proverbs this morning and came upon a familiar verse. If you grew up in independent Baptist churches you have probably heard at least a dozen sermons from Proverbs 22:28:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set"</em></blockquote><br />
I wasn't there, but I can probably tell you how it went. The preacher read this verse from Proverbs - probably only this verse - and preached a barn storming message against any kind of change. Whatever his pet change topic was at the time - music, the KJV, skirts - made it's way into this message. The key point was clear - keep things just as you found them, don't mess with the religion that's been handed to you.</p>
<p>But is that what this verse says? Let's take a closer look at Proverbs 22:28 in context.</p>
<p>Most Proverbs are pretty close to self-standing units. There are many proverbs where there would be nothing wrong with taking a single verse or two verses and running with it, because at least in terms of a literary unit, those verses aren't tied to their immediate context.</p>
<p>Proverbs 22:28 is definitely NOT one of those Proverbs. The context for Proverbs 22:28 is found in verses 22-28:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate: For the Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them. Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go: Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul. Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts. If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee? Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set"</em></blockquote><br />
If you read the verse in context and think about it - it's clear this proverb has nothing at all to do with generational ministry changes and everything to do with the treatment of the poor. In other words, <strong>it's not saying "don't make any changes to anything your fathers have given you" it's saying "don't take poor people's family land away."</strong></p>
<p>For further proof of this, just go to the next chapter - chapter 23 - and look at verses 10-11</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee"</em></blockquote><br />
God has a clear intention for all of His Word and it's our job as Bible students to find out what it is. I think careful study tells us that these verses were not intended to be fuel for the fire of our rage against some ministry change, but rather an admonition against taking advantage of poor people. A message, by the way, that is probably absent in too many of our pulpits.</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, there isn't a verse in scripture that clearly teaches that it's wrong to make changes to things not clearly addressed by scripture. Maybe, the choice of the text was a sign that the preacher was <strong><em>reaching</em></strong>. Maybe, it's just symptomatic and if any ancient landmark has been removed, it was the ancient landmark of <em>"rightly dividing the word."</em></p>
