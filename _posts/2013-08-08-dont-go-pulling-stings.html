<p>As a child, someone gave me a copy of William Bennet&rsquo;s <em>The Book of Virtues</em> as a Christmas gift. After I got over the predictable disappointment that someone gave me a large book with no pictures in it as a Christmas gift, I set about reading it. If you are unfamiliar with <em>The Book of Virtues</em>, or it&rsquo;s companion book, <em>The Moral Compass</em>, they are anthologies of wisdom literature (poetry, parables, fables, etc.) compiled to teach certain morals and virtues to young people.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been remembering a story out of that book.</p>
<p>To summarize, a little boy is whining about how much it stinks to be a little boy, and some magical genie like creature gives him a special gift, a spool of string that can be let out, and as he let&rsquo;s out the string, he skips parts of his life. The boy starts off using it to skip boring classes and chores, but ends up skipping large parts of his youth and young adulthood. When he starts to regret taking out too much string, he sadly realizes that he can&rsquo;t put any back in.</p>
<p>On Monday, I&rsquo;m turning 30. I know, that to many of you that&rsquo;s not that old, but to me it&rsquo;s always been a kind of threshold I really, really wanted to cross. My mentor, Jack Scallions, used to say to me almost weekly &ldquo;No man has any sense until they are 30.&rdquo; But even before I met him, almost since the time I was a teenager, I desperately wanted the respect and stability of adulthood, and I saw 30 as kind of a magic number where those things would be attained.</p>
<p>For the couple years or so, I&rsquo;ve been feeling like I let out too much string. I wanted so badly to be in my thirties, that I despised and resented my 20s. I tried to act like a 30 or 40 something person, dress like a 30 or 40 something person and essentially be something I was not, hoping that no one would notice.</p>
<p>As I look back over the last decade, there are many things I would not change. I&rsquo;m grateful the Lord led me to invest my life in the ministry and in preparation for the ministry. I&rsquo;m grateful for the friends I&rsquo;ve made, the books I&rsquo;ve read, the skills I&rsquo;ve learned and the work I&rsquo;ve done. I&rsquo;m grateful for the times (and there were many of them) I fell flat on my face and had to learn that I am not super man. I&rsquo;m grateful we lived in small apartments, drove old cars, ate cheap food, and barely survived for several years. I&rsquo;m grateful we clawed our way out of debt through all of that. More than anything I&rsquo;m grateful for the family God has given me, for my wife Amanda and my three beautiful children.</p>
<p>I do wish, however, that I had experienced those things with a spirit of contentment about the station of life that God had put me in, and not wasted so much time wishing large chunks of my life away. We might not have a magical ball of string that we can pull out to make time go by, but by wishing we were somewhere else, we do lose the enjoyment and contentment of the moment.</p>
<p>Right now I have three very young children (with all of the diapers and messes they bring) and a small church to pastor. I do look forward to seeing my kids grow up, my house return to some form of order, and my church grow both spiritually and numerically. But I&rsquo;m not wishing this time away - I&rsquo;m enjoying the grace of God in every moment.</p>
