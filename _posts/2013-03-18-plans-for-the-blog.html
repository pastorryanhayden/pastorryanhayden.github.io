<p><em><strong>I really am starting to love blogging.</strong></em> I&rsquo;ve posted on my blog <strong>54 times</strong> since the middle of January. Contrast that with the 40 or so times I posted in the <strong>two years</strong> I had this blog before January, and you can see that&rsquo;s a lot of writing. As much as I love it, and as much as I've loved the positive feedback I've gotten, I&rsquo;m not sure I can keep up the five day a week pace I&rsquo;ve set myself up on.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-2.47.25-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-988" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-18 at 2.47.25 PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-2.47.25-PM-300x153.png" width="300" height="153" /></a></p>
<p>Further, I&rsquo;ve noticed something about my writing that I want to restrain: <strong>I don&rsquo;t want my blog to become the &ldquo;everything that is wrong with revivalistic fundamentalism&rdquo; blog</strong>, which unfortunately is what it seems to be becoming. I don&rsquo;t want to turn into a bitter small church pastor whose spending a significant amount of his time criticizing others.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to be changing some things about the blog.</p>
<h2 id="firstimgoingtobecuttingbackontheseriesblogposts.">First, I&rsquo;m going to be cutting back on the series blog posts.</h2><br />
I can&rsquo;t do it every week. I don&rsquo;t have the stamina to prepare four messages, carry out church business, teach a Bible institute class, spend time with my family, play basketball and volleyball, be a real person, and write five solid blog posts a week. (Whether that was ever happening can remain in question.) I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m never going to write every day. But it won&rsquo;t happen every week.</p>
<h2 id="secondimgoingtobedoingsomeinterviewsofotherpastorsandbloggers.">Second, I&rsquo;m going to be doing some interviews of other pastors and bloggers.</h2><br />
I&rsquo;m going to start a series of online video interviews where I interview Independent Baptists Pastors from around the country and ask them about ministry today. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this. If you&rsquo;d like to be a part of it, just send me an email or a private message.</p>
<h2 id="thirdimgoingtobepostingweeklynotestomyson.">Third, I&rsquo;m going to be posting weekly notes to my son.</h2><br />
I&rsquo;m going to be writing little &ldquo;Dear Noah&rdquo; posts every week or so, each one of them is going to chronicle the things that are happening in our family and the world that week, and going to explain a certain facet of my philosophy. My goal is something similar to Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza&rsquo;s <em>Letters to a Young Conservative</em> only on religious grounds. (I&rsquo;m hoping my son and daughters might read these someday.)</p>
<h2 id="fourthimgoingtoworkharderatbeingbalanced.">Fourth, I&rsquo;m going to work harder at being balanced.</h2><br />
My next blog series is going to be about the things we young people need to do to stay balanced and stay grateful. I&rsquo;m really scared that a whole generation of us preachers really think we&rsquo;ve figured something out that all of our forbears missed and think we have nothing to learn from the older generation. I&rsquo;m hoping to express more of those thoughts in the future.</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas for me to write about? Do you know any pastors (both old and young) who you think I should contact for an interview.</p>
