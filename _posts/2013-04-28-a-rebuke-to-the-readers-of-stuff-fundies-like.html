<p>If you&rsquo;ve read my blog for any length of time, you should know two things about me:1) I am passionate about &ldquo;the issues&rdquo; that we fundamentalist have and want to do everything in my power to make them go away. I&rsquo;ve risked alienation from my Independent Baptist peers by taking a strong stand against things like abuse of the Bible, preacher worship and anti-intellectualism. I&rsquo;m even working on a book (though progress has stalled,) on the issues in fundamentalism and how we need to fix the them. 2) I believe strongly in peaceful, respectful and civil conversation and try to be as nice as possible on this blog. I don&rsquo;t name people. I don&rsquo;t call people names. I try very hard to focus my attention on IDEAS. I want to win hearts and minds, not battles. I&rsquo;m after converts, not casualties.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.stufffundieslike.com/">Stuff Fundies Like</a>, a behemoth of a blog, linked to an <a title="Three Tests for Gray Areas" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/three-tests-for-gray-areas/">article</a> I had written on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SFLBlog?ref=br_tf">Facebook page</a>. Though it resulted in my best blog traffic day ever, it wasn&rsquo;t pretty. I tried to defend myself for a time in their comments and then bailed. I started getting a host of negative, mean spirited comments here on my web site. Somebody accused me of wanting to be the pope of my church. (Anybody who knows me and our church would laugh out loud at that.) Someone else took offense to my mention of Pink Floyd and boldly declared that a Pink Floyd song would be the soundtrack for his entrance into heaven. The things being said at Stuff Fundies Like were much, much uglier.</p>
<p>If they are still paying attention, which I doubt, I&rsquo;d like to say three things to the crowd of Stuff Fundies Like.</p>
<h2 id="thevastmajorityofpeoplewhoattendindependentbaptistchurchesaresincerechristianswhoarejusttryingtoservethelordinthecontextgodplacedthem.">1. The vast majority of people who attend Independent Baptist Churches are sincere Christians who are just trying to serve the Lord in the context God placed them.</h2><br />
There are about 2.5 million independent Baptists in America and over 13,000 independent Baptist churches. Among those millions of members are some real nut jobs. That is an undeniable fact. Among those thousands of churches are the Westboro Baptists of the world. There is, and no one can deny this, a whole lot of ugly in those numbers.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not indicative of all of us. Not even the majority of us. I&rsquo;m a member of a fellowship of independent Baptist pastors here in central Illinois. Not one of the guys who attends those meetings is someone who I would be ashamed of in any way. They are humble guys who love the Lord, love the Bible, and <strong>hate</strong> much of the nonsense that goes on in IFB churches. Even if you could somehow prove that the majority of independent Baptist pastors are manipulative, Bible abusing buffoons (which I don&rsquo;t think you can.) You cannot possibly believe that every member of their churches are. Even the ugliest and most manipulative pastors have members in their churches who love Christ sincerely and are just trying to serve him.</p>
<p>Its wrong to assume, in your vitriolic disgust of those in your background, that everybody who calls themselves an independent Baptists is just like who your pastor (or whatever IFB person set you off) was. You are painting with an awfully large brush. You don&rsquo;t seem interested in cutting out error with a scalpel, you seem to want to drop an A-bomb on Nagasaki. Collateral damage - it&rsquo;s just part of it.</p>
<h2 id="thereisnodueprocessonstufffundieslike.itisguiltyuntilproveninnocent.youhavetunnelvisionandthatalmostneverhappens.">2. There is no &ldquo;due process&rdquo; on Stuff Fundies Like. It is guilty until proven innocent. You have tunnel vision, and that almost never happens.</h2><br />
In my most recent run in with Stuff Fundies Like, they read one of my blog posts, which was really just a teaser for a sermon, on <a href="http://media.sermonaudio.com/mediapdf/411131015100.pdf">3 Tests for Gray Areas</a> and misread my post to think that I was teaching that a pastor has some form of pope like authority over his church. Had they listened to the sermon, read any of several posts on my blog, or asked me they would not have come to that conclusion. But that didn&rsquo;t matter. For the SFL crowd, it is guilty until proven innocent.</p>
<p>One of the greatest complaints many critics have against fundamentalists is the way they handle sin. We have been accused of going after sin with birdshot, rather than a rifle round. They say that we often lump things in as sin that are not sins. This is a recurring theme.</p>
<p>What the SFL crowd does not seem to realize is that in going after the fundamentalists, they have become fundamentalists. They have become exactly the same kind of monsters that they criticize. Only in there case, to simply be a fundamentalist is a sin, and qualifies you for all the scorn, reproach and name calling they can muster.</p>
<p>On that subject&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="thereisabsolutelynoexcuseforpeoplewhocallthemselveschristianstomocksatirizeshameandscornothersthewayyoudoonyoursite.">3. There is absolutely no excuse for people who call themselves Christians to mock, satirize, shame and scorn others the way you do on your site.</h2><br />
I find the content of Stuff Fundies Like to be objectionable sometimes. Often, it is pretty reserved. The comments, on the other hand are the internet equivalent of a fourth grade playground or the wild wild west. People take on fake identities and mock fundamentalists with all they have, holding nothing back. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to see profanity in the comments. Name calling is a standard feature. It&rsquo;s very, very ugly stuff.</p>
<p>SFL Crowd, if you are Christians, you have absolutely no right to talk that way to anybody. Anybody. I know that there are preachers who preach that way, but they are wrong too.</p>
<p>Consider what the Bible says about the way Christians talk:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Colossians4%3A6" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Colossians 4:6</a></blockquote><br />
and</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded. 7 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, 8 <strong>Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</strong>&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Titus2%3A6-7" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Titus 2:6&ndash;7</a>.</blockquote><br />
and</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Ephesians4%3A15" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Ephesians 4:15</a></blockquote><br />
Can you honestly say that Stuff Fundies Like is <em>&ldquo;with grace&rdquo;</em> or that it is <em>&ldquo;sound speech that cannot be condemned&rdquo;</em> or that you are <em>&ldquo;speaking the truth in love&rdquo;</em>?</p>
<p>I can almost hear the objections - you bunch of legalists don&rsquo;t deserve grace, you don&rsquo;t deserve love. What you are doing is sin, and we have the right to condemn it with all the vitriol we can muster.</p>
<p>I disagree. But let&rsquo;s say you are right. Scripture still says <em>&ldquo;let you speech be <strong>alway</strong> with grace.&rdquo;</em> It says that we are to be <em>&ldquo;in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>And if we are sinners. If we are in sin. Scripture still says <em>&ldquo;Fools make a mock at sin.&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Proverbs14%3A9" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Proverbs 14:9</a>.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1><br />
If you have been hurt by fundamentalism, especially independent Baptist fundamentalism, then my heart goes out to you. I seriously doubt there is a single young man or women who grew up in an independent Baptist church in the eighties or nineties who couldn&rsquo;t justifiably take issue with the way some things were handled then. I&rsquo;m sure there are many today being hurt by the excesses of the IFB movement. My heart goes out to all of them.</p>
<p><strong>But two wrongs has never made a right.</strong></p>
<p>If you are lumping everyone together, refusing to give us a chance to defend ourselves, or mocking us hatefully. Then you are wrong, and someday you will stand before God and answer for that.</p>
