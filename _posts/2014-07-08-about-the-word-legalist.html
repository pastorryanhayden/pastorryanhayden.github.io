<p>About a year ago, a dear old lady in our congregation came to me after the service obviously very excited to talk to me. Without any introduction, she just jumped <span id="c52b4d8f-00e1-44e7-a816-2af79a805701" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="b864f507-8386-4d07-8fde-ecc30c88a87d" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">in to</span></span> this conversation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Her: &ldquo;Pastor, I&rsquo;m really glad you are a <span id="9fbc3788-c11e-4050-8531-f58017cc979f" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="7d8d8550-d8b7-4431-ab03-bd5226ee68b0" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">legalist</span></span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have heard that right. Would you please repeat that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her: &ldquo;Pastor, I&rsquo;m really glad you are a <span id="5ca85538-09cb-4909-ae60-faece3ed6386" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="e232de16-028d-412e-8106-ac33edbc22db" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">legalist</span></span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;Do you know what that word means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her: &ldquo;No. But I heard another pastor talking about you and he called you a <span id="168a1401-d320-45d5-8c8b-f3ca071de836" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="f5e7699e-c294-44f4-8fa0-a169538f46aa" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">legalist</span></span>, and when I look at what their church is doing, I&rsquo;m just really glad you are one.&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
I tried to explain to her what the word meant and to tell her that it&rsquo;s not a good thing, but I&rsquo;m not sure she got it. She&rsquo;s still very proud of her legalistic pastor. What I think she means by that is that she&rsquo;s glad I take a stand on some things.</p>
<p>What does the word &ldquo;<span id="dcad8bd1-7fa5-452c-9b5b-2d28a9b5a913" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="64a622e9-4901-4813-85b6-64262622f41f" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">legalist</span></span>&rdquo; or &ldquo;legalism&rdquo; even mean? More times than I care to count, I&rsquo;ve heard an independent Baptist preacher use some variation of the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Legalism is adding works to grace in an attempt to merit salvation.&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
Before I go any <span id="4e016295-85f1-46bc-9922-6e126ed4bd85" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="5a83a9a9-3ca3-47a0-aace-3f1d0f82d536" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">farther</span></span>, I want to say that I agree with that definition. If you are a person who is adding works to grace for salvation (like saying you must be circumcised to be saved) then you are definitely a <span id="4a408e29-8304-450f-951b-65aae81e517f" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="d9eaf502-efe6-4485-b470-f2256082d4ab" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">legalist</span></span>.</p>
<p>I have a problem, however, with making that the exclusive definition of the word. In other words, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with what the above definition says, it just doesn&rsquo;t say enough.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem: <strong>The word &ldquo;legalism&rdquo; is not found in the Bible.</strong> Not even once. Neither is there a definitive theological dictionary defining the term. It&rsquo;s a made up term that means different things to different people. To almost everyone besides a few independent Baptists playing defense, it is a word that <em>includes</em> an overemphasis on rules and standards.</p>
<p>So I would define legalism as:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span id="57571d4d-1cc2-4163-ac04-504f2702a5a6" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="54ecd8be-0c12-4c60-9b26-1116ad6de92d" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">an</span></span> overemphasis on the place of rules either in salvation or Christian living,&rdquo;</p>
<p><span id="08cc39a7-e123-4530-a90c-f3973a50fc3c" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="82b475b2-ddc8-4ad8-ae03-a9d734f4be77" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">or</span></span> more simply &ldquo;an overemphasis on rules.&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
<strong>The &ldquo;don&rsquo;t call me a <span id="474cd610-5940-4db1-a9a1-b744707d26d2" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="493edf94-5ee7-41cc-b22f-6be49a0c62c2" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">legalist</span></span> because I don&rsquo;t think works save you&rdquo; line is a <em>dodge</em>.</strong> It&rsquo;s an attempt to squelch a perfectly legitimate conversation before it even starts. &nbsp;The person who says this knows full well that probably no one is accusing them of adding works to salvation. &nbsp;They know they are being accused of overemphasizing rules. &nbsp;So it's a dodge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also dangerous. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<p>Were there people in the Bible that believed you had to do certain works to be saved? Probably. Those people have always existed. Is that the only misuse of and mis-emphasis of the <span id="89502655-2af9-4632-8359-5c1811fa7b94" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="5ed994b5-7de6-4057-a003-f21c8ff45a95" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">law we</span></span> see in the New Testament? Not hardly.</p>
<p>Take the Pharisees. They were a group absolutely obsessed with rules. Those rules, for the most part, were an extension of scripture. For example, they took the Bible&rsquo;s law about remembering the <span id="536832e7-5b07-4453-af78-85196ee368d6" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="770538fa-be32-4c74-b21c-0093b2a4f56d" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">sabbath</span></span> and doing no work on the Sabbath and made up layers and layers of rules based on that one Old Testament law. By the time Christ came around, they were limiting the distance a person could walk from their house and judging the disciples for picking an ear of corn, rubbing it in their hands and eating it as they walked by a field. They also criticized Jesus for healing on the <span id="f841109d-a21b-45a6-a266-51de30161cc9" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="bbe59950-40a0-4ae7-b558-ab7d547f3a07" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">sabbath</span></span>.</p>
<p>Another example: They took the Old Testament laws about not being around dead people, mingled them with a weird tradition that gentiles have dead things under their houses, and used that to make a hard and fast rule about never entering a gentile&rsquo;s home. It was probably because of this ridiculous rule that the <span id="6ace1493-4124-4062-8de8-46adab8b28ca" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="ac125a0a-5dae-44c2-afa0-054777b8472d" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">jewish</span></span> leaders stayed outside of Pilate&rsquo;s court when they delivered Jesus. They were, in so many ways, stricter than God and Jesus showed people that righteousness is more than following <span id="a9c48491-b9b9-4f4d-818c-66d69a95c4bd" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="08e21bd7-6f9b-46fc-8f88-a8ea3d346c0d" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">some</span></span> <span id="11320427-0ece-4e82-a62b-e7b067332ae9" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="2e2df892-6b57-42ef-ae52-da716f8e8c69" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">manmade</span></span> rules based at some point back in history on the Bible.</p>
<p>You can also look at Galatians. Consider this verse:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;Are ye so foolish? <span id="9fc9006c-e24b-484d-a8a4-5f7db6e9ccaa" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="87e58cdb-05f2-493f-8e91-fafaacbce0f6" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">having</span></span> begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?&rdquo;</em> (Galatians 3:3)</blockquote><br />
It&rsquo;s obvious that there was more going on here <span id="4aaef02b-7b5a-4904-8297-2220be66b8f0" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="6f4bb890-adc9-4e37-aaf6-b482fd1373dc" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">then</span></span> just a bunch of jews teaching people they had to follow <span id="05cfa580-a6a2-464e-a6de-09153febb737" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="a03ae3b8-ae11-46ec-b7c5-28395f503ac8" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">jewish</span></span> rules to be saved. It&rsquo;s obvious that salvation (<em>&rdquo;having begun in the Spirit&rdquo;</em>) wasn&rsquo;t the only thing at issue there (although it was definitely the main thing), that it was sanctification as well (<em>&rdquo;are ye now made perfect&rdquo;</em>) which wasn&rsquo;t to be done by laws&nbsp;(<em>&rdquo;the flesh&rdquo;</em>)</p>
<p>So the New Testament has at least two, and probably more, examples where people who believed the Bible overemphasized rules. The idea that rules can be overemphasized in the Christian life is a biblical idea. <span id="d4ce5150-2af3-4a51-b2cd-54e96d5ceb79" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="e720b33c-e02d-4060-9f90-1f547c60001c" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">Its</span></span> a conversation that we should be having, and for most people, the only word that they know to use in the conversation is &ldquo;<span id="507ccae0-eb50-4421-ad6d-d2eb28cfa951" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="2c95c584-b657-4802-a0a4-bda648f43a66" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">legalist</span></span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the next time you are having a conversation with someone about legalism and they say &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t be <span id="fef540d7-6278-45e5-ab21-2b69e8b31f5b" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">legalists</span>, <span id="32a1dab8-279f-4086-95ed-243e41493928" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">legalists</span> are just people who add works to salvation&rdquo; try asking some of these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where did you get that definition from?</li>
<li>Could you show me a Bible passage or some other definitive source for that <span id="76a3431e-5892-4f0b-bf81-7b8cafe8fad0" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="db20d64f-a333-4026-b930-5559c65458c5" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">definition</span></span> of the word?</li>
<li>Do you recognize that there were people in the Bible (like the Pharisees and Judaizers) that overemphasized the role of rules and laws in their&nbsp;religion?</li>
<li>OK, so you don&rsquo;t like using the word &ldquo;legalism,&rdquo; what word do you want to use for those who overemphasize rules? Can I call them &ldquo;moralists&rdquo; or &ldquo;<span id="a8fd7b09-4c73-4919-b345-cc6260a614b9" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="c4c2730a-d2eb-455d-8e5e-e568c6a91f26" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">nominists</span></span>?&rdquo;</li><br />
</ul><br />
By asking these questions, you can dodge the dodge and steer the conversation back to where it was headed in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>But before you even have that conversation</strong>, you should probably have this one with yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is it possible that you are just balking at holiness?</strong> God calls his children to be distinct from the world. To be a peculiar people. Sometimes that means dressing different, talking different and acting different. This cuts against our flesh. Could this be what is motivating you?</li>
<li><strong>Is it possible that you are struggling with applying biblical principles?</strong> The great principles of the Old and New Testaments are not just for hanging on our walls. First and for most, they are for application. If you have a problem with how someone is applying a biblical principle - ask yourself &ldquo;How am I applying it?&rdquo; If when you are honest with yourself you say that you are not, there may be no legalism involved at all.</li>
<li><strong>Is it possible that this is an authority issue?</strong> God gives authority figures to the church and to the home and those authority figures have a right to set up rules for their respective institutions. I have a right to <em>&ldquo;set in order the things that are wanting&rdquo;</em> in my church and a responsibility to set rules for my family. If you are balking because you don&rsquo;t like your church&rsquo;s leadership requirements, your christian school&rsquo;s dress code, or your dad&rsquo;s curfew at least part of the problem could be an authority issue.</li><br />
</ul><br />
