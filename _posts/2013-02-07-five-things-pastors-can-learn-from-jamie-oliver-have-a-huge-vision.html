<p>This is the third post in my series of &ldquo;things pastors could learn from Jamie Oliver.&rdquo; Please take the time to read the <a title="Five Things Pastors Can Learn From Jamie Oliver: Introduction." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/five-things-pastors-can-learn-from-jamie-oliver-introduction/">introduction</a> and first <a title="Things Pastors Could Learn From Jamie Oliver: Be Authentic" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/things-pastors-could-learn-from-jamie-oliver-be-authentic/">thing</a>.</p>
<h1 id="haveahugevision.">Have a huge vision.</h1><br />
I watch the Food network some, but I didn&rsquo;t first hear about Jamie Oliver (a celebrity chef) on the food network. I heard about Jamie Oliver on a public speaking blog. Jamie Oliver had given a speech about the poor state of American eating at the TED conference and his performance, while not exactly polished, was memorable enough that it was getting a lot of attention on public speaking web sites and this site I was reading linked to it.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-07-at-1.25.03-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-575" alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-07 at 1.25.03 PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-07-at-1.25.03-PM-300x168.png" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>So I watched the fifteen minute video. (You can watch it below.) Basically Oliver said that 1) Most of our diseases and health care costs are diet related, 2) Regular people don&rsquo;t know how to cook anymore, and 3) we could prevent a lot of this by changing school lunches and teaching people how to cook and grow their own food.</p>
<p>Then Jamie Oliver told of how he had made it his mission to fix it. How he&rsquo;d reformed school lunches in Great Britain, how he was teaching troubled kids over there how to cook and how he&rsquo;d gone to the most unhealthy city in America (Huntington, WV at the time) and started working on the schools and people there. He laid out a big problem and basically said &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing about it, come help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether or not you agree with Jamie Oliver&rsquo;s conclusions about the low state of American eating (I&rsquo;m not 100% on board, but it&rsquo;s sure made me think) you still have to admire a common guy for seeing such a huge problem and trying to do something about it.</p>
<p>What can we pastors learn from this?</p>
<h2 id="definetheproblem.makeitreal.">1. Define the problem. Make it real.</h2><br />
For Jamie Oliver, the problem was the poor diet of people in America and Great Britain. If you listen to the speech, he didn&rsquo;t just name the problem, he named statistics, he laid out the dire consequences of ignoring the problem. In the most memorable moment of his speech, he brought out a wheelbarrow full of sugar cubes, dumped it on the stage, and started wading in them. He told the audience that this was the sugar kids were getting in an annual portion of their school milk! The problem got real.</p>
<p>What problem get&rsquo;s you moving? Do you know how many lost people are in your city? In your neighborhood? On your street? Do you know how many or how few people were baptized in your church last year?</p>
<p>Too often our goals are so nebulous and undefined that we can&rsquo;t even describe them ourselves. He who aims at nothing always hits his mark, and if our goals are not well defined, there is no way we are going to hit them.</p>
<h2 id="findoutwhatitwouldtaketofixit.">2. Find out what it would take to fix it.</h2><br />
Jamie Oliver laid out some pretty radical steps to fix this problem of diet: His plan included national attention, school lunch program reforms,and educational classes in cooking for both adults and students. Lofty goals to say the least.</p>
<p>What would it take to accomplish your goals? Money? Canvasing your entire city with the gospel? A targeted program to incorporate the bus children more fully into your church? Everyone in your church giving more to missions.</p>
<p>At some point you have to move from goals to objectives. Goals are merely a destination, objectives are travel plan. You can say till your blue in the face that you want to go to Scotland some day, but until you find out how much tickets and lodging cost, set a date and start saving, you are never going to accomplish that goal.</p>
<h2 id="start.">3. Start.</h2><br />
Jamie Oliver got funding for a TV show, secured a storefront in downtown Huntington, WV. Got permission to take over the school lunches there for a few weeks and hit the streets and the radio with his message. By similar tactics, he had already reformed the school lunch programs in England. He didn&rsquo;t just stop at defining the problem, he didn&rsquo;t bemoan the large scale of it, he started doing something.</p>
<p>Sometimes we can get a huge vision to do something for God and then let the scope of it scare us into never taking the first steps. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine starting a bus ministry when you don&rsquo;t have a bus, or building a new church building when you have no excess money in the bank.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s inspiring about Jamie Oliver&rsquo;s example is he realized the issue of diet was way too huge for him to tackle alone, but he didn&rsquo;t let that stop him. He went to the heart of the problem and did what he could, and doing that inspired others to follow.</p>
<h2 id="sacrifice.">4. Sacrifice.</h2><br />
Early on in Jamie Oliver&rsquo;s career, he got the idea of teaching at risk youth to cook as a way to help them on their feet and give them direction in life. He refinanced his house (without asking his wife) and used the equity to help start a restaurant for that end. His program has been going for years now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to talk about a vision for winning the lost of our city while we sit comfortably behind a desk all week (I know from experience) but I doubt we&rsquo;ll ever inspire others to follow God if they don&rsquo;t see us, their pastors, out ahead in sacrifice.<br />
It&rsquo;s easy to ask others to contribute sacrificially to a building fund project, but much harder to part with the money God has given us.</p>
<p>So to sum it all up, have a crazy vision, make it real, make a plan, and get after it with all you&rsquo;ve got.</p>
