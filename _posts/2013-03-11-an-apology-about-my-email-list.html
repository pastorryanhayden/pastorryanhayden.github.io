<p>My email list is broken. &nbsp;It has for weeks been sending out empty emails. &nbsp;I've been trying to get it fixed, but have been unable to. &nbsp;So I'm turning it off.</p>
<p>If your email inbox has been&nbsp;barraged&nbsp;with empty emails, I'm sorry. &nbsp;Maybe some point in the future I can get it working right.</p>
