<p>Inbox is the new Gmail - or is it? That&rsquo;s the buzz around the techy corners of the internet lately since Google introduced this new invite-only alternative to Gmail. Now, I love me some Gmail. I have used mailbox, boxer, airmail, sparrow and a host of other apps, but I always come back to Gmail. I have the Gmail app as my main mail app on my iPhone, my iPad and my Nexus and I use Gmail in the browser on my Mac to manage my emails. On all of my devices, I keep the default default email client set up (mostly for composing and mailto links) but I much prefer to use Gmail.</p>
<p>Gmail has two killer features that cause me to use it over the built in apps from Apple. <strong>1 - it organizes my emails into tabs</strong> (i.e. updates, promotions, social, etc.). So I don&rsquo;t have to search through a list of 15 spammy promotions to get to the one real email in my inbox. <strong>2 - it enables me to archive all of the emails in a given tab in two clicks.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2014-11-01-08.16.04.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2000" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2014-11-01-08.16.04-1024x653.png" alt="Screenshot 2014-11-01 08.16.04" width="742" height="473" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So any replacement for gmail has to at least do these two things.</p>
<p>Inbox not only does them, but does them better. Google has expanded the tab concept into what it calls &ldquo;bundles&rdquo; which are even more useful than &ldquo;tabs&rdquo; and it now takes only one click to make a list of spammy promotions go into the archive bin.</p>
<p>So right from the get-go - I&rsquo;m prone to switch to Inbox. It takes the best features of gmail and makes them better.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all - it also adds features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A beautiful layout</strong> - Inbox is much, much, much easier on the eyes than Gmail ever was. I mean, by a factor of 10.</li>
<li><strong>A rudimentary task manager</strong> - Inbox has a&nbsp;todo list&nbsp;built in. It&rsquo;s super easy to add tasks and those tasks show up right in your email. You can even assign those tasks to show up on a certain day or at a certain location.</li>
<li>T<strong>he ability to turn an email into a todo in one click.</strong> Many times, email acts as a todo list anyways, so this feature just makes sense.</li>
<li><strong>Quick access to those you frequently communicate with</strong> - just press the plus button and circle icons for the those you most often communicate with are right there. &nbsp;Click on their circle and it opens compose.</li>
<li><strong>The ability to &ldquo;snooze&rdquo; emails.</strong> If I get an important email that I don&rsquo;t want to deal with until tomorrow morning, I can send it out of my inbox until tomorrow morning.</li><br />
</ul><br />
My only gripe about Inbox, and it is a minor one, is that there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a way to reorder tasks. That seems like it should be an easy feature to add in a later update.</p>
<p>So the long and short of it is this - Inbox is awesome. It&rsquo;s hype is deserved. If and when you do get an invite or they open it up - you should give it a week as your email program. You probably won&rsquo;t go back.</p>
<p>You can check out these features in this short (silent) video:</p>
