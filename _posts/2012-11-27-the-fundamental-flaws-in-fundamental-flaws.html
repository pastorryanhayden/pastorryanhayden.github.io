<h2>Or How Not To Write A Book Critiquing Fundamentalism</h2><br />
<a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/fundyflaws.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-290" title="fundyflaws" alt="" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/11/fundyflaws.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a> Last night, I bought and read the book (Epamphlet? Extended rant? Book might be too generous) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fundamental-Flaws-Independent-Baptists-ebook/dp/B00A4SKJXG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354027996&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fundamental+flaws"><em>Fundamental Flaws</em></a> by Darrell Dow, the blogger/curator behind the unfortunately popular blog<a href="http://www.stufffundieslike.com/"> stufffundieslike.com</a>. If you've never read stufffundieslike, and you couldn't figure out by the title, it is a website dedicated to making fun of the fundamentalist movement. I've always believed we should accept criticism openly and honestly and try to learn as much from it as possible, so while I don't enjoy reading the website, it's been in my RSS reader for a long time now. <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-27-at-9.02.48-AM.png"><img class=" wp-image-291 alignright" title="Screen Shot 2012-11-27 at 9.02.48 AM" alt="" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-27-at-9.02.48-AM-300x168.png" width="210" height="118" /></a> When I saw that the author had written a book about the flaws in fundamentalism, I jumped. While I am a committed fundamentalist, I too think that there are "fundamental flaws" in the Fundamental Baptist movement and have been working on my own book for months which I'm calling <em>We've Got Issues (But I Wouldn't Want To Be Anybody Else)</em>. I'll include a sample chapter at the end of this post. <em>Fundamental Flaws</em> had promise. I wanted to like it. If nothing else, I was at least hoping it would furnish some research. Unfortunately, I have to say there are too many "flaws" in <em>Fundamental Flaws</em> for me to recommend it. Here are the main ones:</p>
<h2>Overall Tone</h2><br />
Nietzsche said (by way of another blogger, I don't read Nietzsche) "Be careful when you fight the monsters, lest you become one." I would say Dow makes the same mistakes as those he is trying to criticize: he paints with too broad a brush, refuses to acknowledge degrees and makes sweeping generalizations and assumptions about fundamentalism. Statements abound like:</p>
<blockquote><p>"In fundamentalism nothing is more important than the keeping of God&rsquo;s laws." "The 3 R's of Reading, Writing, and 'Rithmatic are all but replaced by Repetitive moralism, Republican politics, and Righteous indignation." "Since the Gospel that Fundamentalists preach is one of mandatory cultural conformity, any other group that attempts to meet people&rsquo;s economic, medical, or educational needs without first converting them is labeled a &ldquo;social gospel.&rdquo;" and "So fundamentalists go about their lives with one ear always listening for the trumpet. But while they&rsquo;re listening they also find time to go to a Bible college, get married, have lots of kids. Just in case."</blockquote><br />
When I first started reading his blog, my initial theory was that maybe Dow was the victim of growing up in a really messed up fundamentalist church. But upon reading this book, no one fundamentalist church could be guilty of all of the things he writes about. In my opinion, Dow has created a caricature of fundamentalism and is criticizing the caricature. It's "straw men" writing at it's worst, and when you consider that it is applied to churches and pastors who, for the most part, are innocently (if not ignorantly) trying to live out the Bible then this mean spirited fundy-bashing is inexcusable.</p>
<h2>Lack of Facts</h2><br />
If I were to take fundamentalism to court, I couldn't use a single part this book, it is entirely hearsay. Consistent with his "straw man" approach, the book contains not a single example, fact, or footnote and contains very little scripture. You cannot write a book categorically demonizing an independent movement of thousands of churches based solely on your personal observations. If Dow wants to say that the purpose of Christian schools is to perpetuate fundamentalist subculture, or that fundamentalist missionaries think they are the last hope of the world, he could at least furnish us with a quote or two. He doesn't. To me, that is the greatest failing of this book.</p>
<h2>Sex</h2><br />
While the book does make several arguments that I agree with, I reject outright the entire chapter on sex. Basically, Dow says that fundamentalist are extremely prudish on the topic of sex, making the entire thing taboo. That much may be true (although, I would argue that it isn't a bad thing, more on that in a second) but then Dow goes on to suggest that sex education should be open and available and that we should celebrate the sexual openness of our culture. To this I have to ask: In what context? If Dow is arguing for sex education in a married couples class - ehh? maybe. But if Dow is, as it seems, arguing that we need to go into detail about sexual functions and even give "tips" to teenagers and unmarried people - I have a real problem with that. The biblical world was, with the possible exception of Jewish society, a sexually open world. Prostitution and pornography were an integral part of the "worship" of the pagan deities (which was their biggest draw.) A casual reading of Genesis or Judges would tell you that the ancient world was not immune to sexual debauchery. Yet, on the whole, the Bible manages to deal with sexuality with a large measure of discretion. While I would say that there is certainly scripture that encourages the enjoyment of sexuality in the marriage relationship; the Bible nowhere takes the "have fun and make lot's of babies" approach that Dow advocates, and is always careful to limit positive discussion of sexuality to the marriage relationship (which Dow doesn't even mention in his chapter.)</p>
<p>The only part of the chapter that I agree with is that Independent Baptists have had a bad track record with sexual abuse and that we need to get serious about examining the root causes of that.</p>
<h2>Education</h2><br />
In his chapter on education, Dow seemed to make the point that Christian education is more or less solely an incubator for fundamentalist subculture and that by and large, it does children harm by isolating them from the world of secular ideas. There was one statement in this chapter that I really enjoyed and agreed with, Dow said "Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to answer the question of whether or not fundamentalism can win on its own in the arena of ideas. . ." so far, I really like it, but Dow continues " . . .without needing to start the process in kindergarten." As someone who has been involved in Christian education since he was 3 (the last year and a half was the first time in my life that I wasn't either enrolled in or employed by a Christian school) I would agree that Christian education has its failings and that we need to do a better job teaching children to think through, rather than avoid, the issues of the day. But like so many parts of this book, Dow's argument is entirely one sided. Dow says nothing about the general high quality of Christian education (in the lower grades) or about the atrocities in experimentation that went on for fifty years in public school reading and math programs or about the revisionist bend of public school "social studies". He says nothing about the biblical command to <em>"teach them diligently"</em> or <em>"bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."</em> While I agree my children shouldn't be kept in an idea bubble forever, I 'm not going to through them into the coliseum to fight off the wolves while they are still babies.</p>
<h2>Other problems</h2><br />
There are other things I take issue with in this book, (the entire chapter on missions for example) but this blog post is already too long and I am not going to give any more of my time to this. Does the fundamental movement have its flaws? Absolutely. Those flaws need to be dealt with and at least named. But we must do this fairly while recognizing that the vast majority of fundamentalists are not like the straw man that Dow presents, and also that the majority of those who are are doing it ignorantly and innocently, not out of malice. That is what I am going to try to do in my upcoming book,</p>
<p><em>We've Got Issues (But I Wouldn't Want To Be Anybody Else)</em>. The book should be available sometime next spring. Below is a link to a sample chapter. <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Weve-Got-Issues-sample.pdf">We've Got Issues - sample</a></p>
