<p>In Leviticus 19:26-28 God gave these commands to his people:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood:neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times. Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you:I am the Lord.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
It&rsquo;s pretty clear&nbsp;these verses go together. All of these things - eating things with blood, enchantment, shaved heads, cuttings and tattoos - were associated with paganism and were forbidden to the jews.</p>
<p>Obviously, we aren&rsquo;t under the law, and there is nothing inherently evil about shaved heads or beards or even tattoos. But there is a principle here: G<strong>od wants His people to be different and to avoid doing things associated with paganism.</strong></p>
<p>This command is repeated in Leviticus 21:5-6, where God tells the priests:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God:for the offerings of the Lord made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer:therefore they shall be holy.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
If regular rank and file jews were commanded not to do these things, it was especially important that the spiritual leaders didn&rsquo;t do them, because they were involved in the Lord&rsquo;s holy work.</p>
<p>Is it just me, or <em>has the whole concept of keeping the things of God separate and distinct from the way the lost world worships their gods fallen by the wayside?</em></p>

<p>Consider this: Last weekend my father in law showed me a hilarious video of three ladies singing a mom themed parody of Queen&rsquo;s Bohemian Rhapsody. It was well done, with intricate choreography, props and even smoke and lights. But about fifteen seconds into the video, I thought &ldquo;Where is this being done?&rdquo; It was done in a church.</p>
<p><strong>A church decided that the best use of their worship time and resources was parodying a song, complete with lights, smoke and props, popularized by an all gay hard rock group.</strong></p>
<p>Even more heartbreaking, a quick YouTube search shows many other churches copied&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Whatever <em>&ldquo;come out from among them and be ye separate, touch not the unclean thing&rdquo;</em> does mean, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it doesn&rsquo;t mean imitate the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in contemporainity. I think 21st century churches should be 21st century churches. Our church has screens. I preach from an iPad. We sing from a hymn book that includes many songs written in the last few decades. (<em>Rejoice Hymns</em> by Majesty Music, in case you were wondering.) I&rsquo;m not fighting the 21st century.</p>
<p>That being said, theres a difference between fitting in in the 21st century and fitting in in a rock concert, between being culturally relevant and being culturally reverent, between not fighting the 21st century and swallowing it whole.</p>
<p>I think the Bible is pretty clear that God wants His people to look, act and sing different than&nbsp;the world around them. If something is associated with the worship of false gods, whether it be a god with a name like Oden, Diana or Zeus or a god with a name like Cosmopolitan, Madison Avenue or Metallica it shouldn&rsquo;t be mimicked by those worshipping the One True God.</p>
<p>I still think Churches should look like churches, not night clubs. I still think pastors should look like pastors, not comedians or rock stars. I still think Church music should sound like church music, not like what is being played on my local country, rock or rap channel. I wouldn&rsquo;t get a tattoo, not because they are inherently evil, but because they are closely associated with things that are. I don&rsquo;t want a trap set or electric guitar on my platform, not because either instrument is inherently evil (they&rsquo;re not) but because they are closely associated with things that are.</p>
<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s old fashioned, I think that&rsquo;s Bible.</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s preach timeless truth in a timely way, but let&rsquo;s not forget that the message we preach is an outright attack on many elements of our current culture and that God expects our lifestyle and worship style to match our message.</p>
