<p>Every morning, I glance through dozens of blog posts. If post title interests me, I read it. If I feel like it would be helpful to my friends, I share it on Facebook, twitter, and Google+. This would probably take a ton of time if I went to each blog and web site to get this information, but it doesn&rsquo;t take me very long at all because it is delivered to my computer, my iPhone, and my iPad instantly and what I read and like stays in sync between devices.</p>
<p>[box]I'm working on a book full of tech tips for pastors. Your iPad doesn't have to be a paperweight and your computer can do more than check email or facebook. Sign up for my email list (to the right) to be updated as soon as it's available.[/box]</p>
<p>As a pastor, this regular flow of content has been very helpful. Whereas someone from a generation ago would have read the Sword of the Lord and been stuck with whatever the editor found interesting and stuck waiting for it&rsquo;s weekly or monthly release, I can pick and choose content based on the authors, news sources, or even topics and get it as often as I want. While I do miss having a constant source of newsprint paper to start my charcoal grill, I don&rsquo;t miss having a garage full or wastebasket full of newspapers that I didn&rsquo;t read.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Photo-Jan-26-5-35-55-PM1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-469" alt="Photo Jan 26, 5 35 55 PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Photo-Jan-26-5-35-55-PM1-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>This is something I think all pastors should do, and if you have a computer, a smartphone or a tablet, it&rsquo;s not difficult at all. If you follow the steps below, you should be well on your way to having your own personal, always up-to-date, news source for whenever you get a spare moment.</p>
<p>All it takes is four simple steps:</p>
<h2 id="signupforagoogleaccountorsigninifyoualreadyhaveone.">1. Sign up for a google account (or sign in if you already have one.)</h2><br />
I think everyone should have a <a href="https://accounts.google.com/NewAccount">gmail account</a>. They&rsquo;re absolutely free, and in terms of features, they blow away any competitors. If your email address says anything but @gmail.com or @your-company.com anyone at all tech savvy is going to assume you are stuck in the 1990&rsquo;s. (This is especially true if you have an aol or juno email address.)</p>
<p>On top of great email, having a gmail account opens the doors to lots of other features, such as Google Drive, Google Calendar and today&rsquo;s topic - Google Reader.</p>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve signed into Google, you should see a black bar across the top of the browser window, and on that bar you will find a button labeled "other." Click on that and then click on "reader."</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screenshot_1_26_13_5_45_PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-473" alt="Screenshot_1_26_13_5_45_PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screenshot_1_26_13_5_45_PM-300x194.png" width="300" height="194" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="getaquatintedwithgooglereader.">2. Get aquatinted with Google Reader.</h2><br />
Google reader is an online RSS reader. It&rsquo;s the program that allows for you to have internet content delivered to you in one centralized place rather than hunting for it across the internet.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screenshot_1_26_13_5_48_PM-2.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-474" alt="Screenshot_1_26_13_5_48_PM-2" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screenshot_1_26_13_5_48_PM-2-300x129.png" width="300" height="129" /></a></p>
<h4 id="excursus:whatisanrssreader">Excursus: What is an RSS reader?</h4><br />
RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. Every time a blog or news web site updates, it sends out message to all RSS readers that are following it saying that there is new content available. The RSS reader then downloads that new content. RSS readers can do this from thousands of websites, giving you one place to view all of the blogs or news sites you follow.[/questionbox]</p>
<p>All this is great, but right now, you are probably looking at an empty Google Reader account. That&rsquo;s where the next step comes in.</p>
<h2 id="fillyourgooglereaderaccountupwithreallygreatcontent.">3. Fill your Google Reader account up with really great content.</h2></p>
<h4 id="thegooglereadermethod.">The Google Reader method.</h4><br />
With Google Reader open, you should see a big red button on the top left that says &ldquo;Subscribe&rdquo;, and if you click it, you&rsquo;ll see a small window that says &ldquo;Enter a search term to find feeds or paste a feed url.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screenshot_1_26_13_5_49_PM-2.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-475" alt="Screenshot_1_26_13_5_49_PM-2" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screenshot_1_26_13_5_49_PM-2-300x153.png" width="300" height="153" /></a></p>
<p>If you already know what web site you want to follow (ryan-hayden.com) just enter it into that box. You will then be subscribed to all of the new content from that web site. You can also enter a search term (i.e. &ldquo;ministry tech&rdquo; or &ldquo;fundamentalism&rdquo;) and get a list of possible blogs to follow, with a &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; button next to each. You could do this for your favorite news site, your favorite sports team, etc.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t have to signed in the Google Reader window to do this. There is also&hellip;</p>
<h4 id="thewhileyouarebrowsingmethod.">The while you are browsing method.</h4><br />
Have you ever noticed in the URL bar of your browser (where you type in the website) or on certain blogs, an orange icon with a diagonal signal on it? That is the RSS icon, and it means that the site you are on has an RSS &ldquo;feed&rdquo; attached to it that can be subscribed to. Once you notice this symbol, you&rsquo;ll start seeing them all over the internet.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screenshot_1_26_13_5_52_PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-476" alt="Screenshot_1_26_13_5_52_PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screenshot_1_26_13_5_52_PM.png" width="196" height="71" /></a></p>
<p>When you click on that symbol (at least in <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/?&amp;brand=CHMB&amp;utm_campaign=en&amp;utm_source=en-ha-na-us-sk&amp;utm_medium=ha">Google Chrome</a>, which in my opinion is the only web browser you should be using anyway, but that&rsquo;s another post) you&rsquo;ll be brought to an RSS page. Which for all intensive purposes is pretty useless. You can copy and paste the URL of that page into Google Reader, but that involves opening that window again.</p>
<p>If you are using a browser (Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera) that has extensions (little add-on programs, not fake hair), then you can add a free extension to it that will give you another set of options when you click the RSS button. Because I use Google Chrome, I&rsquo;ll walk you through setting up that browser.</p>
<p>With Google Chrome open, click<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-subscription-extensio/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd?hl=en-US"> this link</a> and then click the add to Chrome button.</p>
<p>[sstoggles][sstoggle title="Or do it the long way and learn about Chrome Extensions"]On the menu button (it&rsquo;s at the far right of the screen and looks like three lines stacked on top of each other&ldquo;) and then select &rdquo;settings.&ldquo; This will open a new &rdquo;Settings" page. On the left of this page is a menu and in the middle of it, is a extensions option. Click on that to bring up your extensions page.</p>
<p>At the bottom of this page is link that says &ldquo;Get more extensions&rdquo; clicking on that will bring up a &ldquo;store&rdquo; where you can add free chrome extensions.</p>
<p>In the search box at the top of this window, type &ldquo;RSS&rdquo; and then click the search button. At the very top of the list that comes up should be &ldquo;RSS Subscription Extension (by Google)&rdquo; Click the &ldquo;Add to Chrome&rdquo; button next to it.[/sstoggle][/sstoggles]</p>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve done this, go back to a blog and click on the RSS icon again. This time, you&rsquo;ll be brought to a different page, and at the very top of it, you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to subscribe to the blog using whatever RSS reader you have set up (Google Reader is the default.)</p>
<p>Now whenever you find yourself on a blog or news site that is interesting, you can click the little orange icon, add it to your google reader, and fresh content from that site will be delivered to you automagically.</p>
<p>Google Reader is useful, and while it&rsquo;s a good place to collect your content, it&rsquo;s not the best interface for reading it. Why? For one, it&rsquo;s ugly and a bit clunky. Also, at the moment, there is no Google Reader app for the iPhone or iPad, which puts a lot of people out. Fortunately, there is a great free app, available for Windows, Mac, iPhone and Android that access your Google Reader feed and solves those problems&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="addthefeedlyapptoyourwebbrowserphoneandtablet.">4. Add the Feedly app to your web browser, phone, and tablet.</h2><br />
On your computer, with Google Chrome open, go to http://www.feedly.com/ and click on the &ldquo;Connect to Google Reader&rdquo; button. Add your Google account credentials in the field that comes up, and you should see a much prettier version of your Google Reader feed.</p>
<p><a href="http://feedly.com"><img class="size-medium wp-image-477 alignnone" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-01-26_at_3.18.13_PM-2" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screen_Shot_2013-01-26_at_3.18.13_PM-2-300x196.png" width="300" height="196" /></a></p>
<p>You can get this same feed optimized for you smartphone or tablet. Just search for &ldquo;Feedly&rdquo; in the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEIQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Ffeedly-your-google-reader%2Fid396069556%3Fmt%3D8&amp;ei=eUcEUcboIZS08ATRpIGQBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGlQ2ooxgIRiGKI9iMZzNzzZypzvA&amp;sig2=Hg1J1gNyWeCaC3IuVNMLzQ&amp;bvm=bv.41524429,d.eWU">iTunes App Store</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.devhd.feedly%26hl%3Den&amp;ei=kkcEUYfkMYGs8QT1hoHQCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHupNEjPMx1IFpm4sRGIIeGQ6CmSw&amp;sig2=1v4qWwrHGhcU2qfXIHY_Vw&amp;bvm=bv.41524429,d.eWU">Google Play</a> and download the app. Once it&rsquo;s downloaded, click the &ldquo;Connect to Google Reader&rdquo; button, enter your credentials, and you are good to go.</p>
<p>There are several great things about having feedly on all of your devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>It keeps track of what you&rsquo;ve read and keeps that in sync across devices.</li>
<li>It allows you to save an article to read later, and pull it up on any of your devices with the Feedly app.</li>
<li>It is beautiful.</li>
<li>It allows you to easily post articles to Facebook, Google+, Twitter and other social networks.</li><br />
