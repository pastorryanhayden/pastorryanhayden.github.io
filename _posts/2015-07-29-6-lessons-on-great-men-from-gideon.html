<p>Gideon was the greatest man of the Judges period, a period that took up about a third of Old Testament history. I say that for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gideon is given more text time than any other figure in Judges.</li>
<li>Gideon was so revered by Israel that they tried to make him king and his family a dynasty.</li>
<li>Gideon is probably the most famous character (with Samson being the only competition) in Judges.</li>
<li>Gideon&rsquo;s name makes it into the "Hall of Faith" in Hebrews 11.</li>
<li>Gideon led what is probably the most brazen military attack&nbsp;in history - taking on an innumerable army with three hundred soldiers armed with pots, trumpets and lanterns.</li><br />
</ul><br />
So Gideon was a "great man," about that there can be no doubt.</p>
<p>But, if you take what Judges says about Gideon as a whole (chapters 6-9), it is not Gideon&rsquo;s greatness that comes out.</p>
<p>In <strong>Job 32:9</strong> Elihu says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</em></blockquote><br />
Gideon probably serves as as good an example of that truth as you&rsquo;ll find in scripture. At the end of the Gideon section of Judges, Israel was in far worse condition than at the beginning. Israel was more idolatrous than they were at the outset and they were being ruled by a bloody violent psychopath.</p>
<p>In chapters 8 and 9 (which record the majority of Gideon&rsquo;s life) we see the reasons why:</p>
<h2>1. Great men sometimes make terrible decisions.</h2><br />
In chapter 8 Gideon is trying to finish the job he started in chapter 7. He&rsquo;s trying to hunt down the rest of the Midianite leaders who got away so that they don&rsquo;t regroup and oppress Israel. He comes to a town (Succoth) and asks for bread - the people of that town show no gratitude for Gideon and refuse to feed his men. Gideon comes to another town (Penial) and asks for bread and gets the same treatment. It seems that the people in these towns were afraid that Gideon couldn&rsquo;t do the job and that they would face repercussions for helping Gideon.</p>
<p>So what does Gideon do? He says to Succoth (8:7)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.</em></blockquote><br />
And to Penial he says (8:9)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.</em></blockquote><br />
Gideon, who just a few verses earlier was describing himself as "the least in Israel" is now bristling at anybody who dared to question or doubt <em>him</em>. Gideon does not say &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s hard to believe, I struggled to believe to, just trust God.&rdquo; He says, essentially &ldquo;You doubt me, now you are going to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when he gets back from his mission, he&rsquo;s as good as his word. He makes them pay. He rounds up the men of Succoth and beats them publicly to make an example of them. What he does to Penial is worse - he doesn&rsquo;t beat these jews - he kills them.</p>
<p>Gideon, just a chapter earlier, had a conversation with preincarnate Christ and doubted <strong>His</strong> word and required not one but at least three miraculous signs to muster the courage to obey. Yet here he cannot forgive these jews for doubting the word of <strong>Gideon</strong>?? At best Gideon was being hypocritical and applying double standards here - at worst he was being narcissistic and vindictive. Either way, his decisions were sinful, terrible and wrong.</p>
<h2>2. Great men sometimes have terrible personal lives.</h2><br />
Judges 8:30-31 says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives. And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.</em></blockquote><br />
Gideon had many wives and at least one concubine. We may be able to overlook the many wives thing (although personally I think God always intended marriage to be between one man and one woman.) But did he need <em>more</em>?</p>
<p>As you could guess, his family life was a mess&hellip;</p>
<h2>3. Great men sometimes do great work with terrible motivations.</h2><br />
Lets go backwards in the story for a second. In chapter 8:18-19, Gideon catches up with the princes of Midian who had got away. He asks them an interesting question that sheds a little light into Gideon&rsquo;s motivations. He asks them about some people that they had killed in Tabor. The princes reveal that they looked like him. Then Gideon says <em>"they were my brethren, even the sons of my mother." </em></p>
<p>Wait? I thought Gideon was doing this simply out of obedience to God. I thought he was just trying to obey the angel of the Lord. At some point, that motivation was replaced or at least supplemented with the motivation of revenge.</p>
<p>In order to humiliate these princes, he asks his oldest child - who at this point is just a boy, to do the killing. Which leads to the next point:</p>
<h2>4. Great men sometimes make terrible parents.</h2><br />
Having your young son carry out your act of vengeance isn&rsquo;t exactly step number one in "the seven habits of highly effective parents." But, if you read the rest of the story and see how his children acted - it seems pretty clear this wasn&rsquo;t Gideon&rsquo;s only parenting failure. Gideon&rsquo;s son Abimelech (which ironically means &ldquo;my father the king&rdquo;) manipulates himself into being the king and it&rsquo;s obvious that Abimelech is a murdering, idolatrous psychopath. After three years as king, Abimelech was murdered by his own people, but not before all but one of Gideon&rsquo;s 70 children were murdered and Gideon&rsquo;s name forever sullied.</p>
<hr />
<p>But I&rsquo;ve jumped ahead a little in the story. At the end of chapter 8, the people of Israel try to make Gideon a king and his family a dynasty. Gideon showed some amazing grace in not accepting that offer and pointing the people to God.</p>
<p>What Gideon did next, however, could only be considered foolish. After turning down the kingdom, he asked the men for the golden spoils of war, and when they gave them to him, he took them and made an ephod - kind of like a vest - out of them.</p>
<p>The Bible says this about the ephod: (8:27)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city,even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.</em></blockquote><br />
The children of Israel literally went to Ophrah to idolize an article of Gideon&rsquo;s clothing. (It probably also was Gideon usurping the high priesthood at Bethel.) Which leads to another conclusion of Gideon&rsquo;s life about great men...</p>
<h2>5. Great men sometimes can be idolized.</h2><br />
People weren&rsquo;t enamored with God - they were enamored with Gideon. Rather than rushing to Bethel to worship God and thank Him at the tabernacle, they ran to Ophrah to worship their hero Gideon and gaze at his magnificent ephod.</p>
<p>Looking at all of Gideon&rsquo;s life, I can&rsquo;t help but come to one final conclusion:</p>
<h2>6. Great men sometimes aren&rsquo;t that great.</h2><br />
Before Gideon was famous he doubted God&rsquo;s call, demanded a sign, probably timidly obeyed God&rsquo;s first command by destroying his father&rsquo;s altar at night, then timidly raised an army, then asked God for two more signs, then had to have his courage propped up by a visit to the Midianite camp before the battle.</p>
<p>After Gideon was famous he showed erratic behavior, vengefulness against his own people, made terrible and sinful decisions as regards his own family, and was not careful about deflecting the glory to God. In short Gideon left things worse than He found them.</p>
<p>If there is a hero in this story that is to be worshipped - it&rsquo;s God, not Gideon. God was faithful to His people when they weren&rsquo;t faithful to Him. God mercifully saw the condition of His children and brought deliverance - even though He knew they would go back into idolatry. We even see Christ in this story (the Angel of the Lord.) He&rsquo;s the one who needs to be worshipped. Gideon was just the tool God decided to paint with - and He wasn&rsquo;t a great one either.</p>
<hr />
<p>The lessons from this story are obvious. Today, we are told to honor and revere the "great men." There are preachers who cannot give a single sermon without mentioning their preaching hero. There are churches with pictures of their preaching hero in the auditorium. There are preachers that love the glory of a standing ovation and who quickly become obsessed with their own power and importance and begin to act like little kings.</p>
<p>Yet sometimes, those same preaching heros made terrible decisions, often acted with bad motivations, had messed up family lives, set themselves up on too high a pedestal, and left problems for the generations that followed them.</p>
<p>Praise God for what He is able to do with feeble man. But let&rsquo;s move beyond heroes and emphasize the Hero. Let&rsquo;s move beyond the "great men" and emphasize the &ldquo;Son of man.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s treat the great figures of the past the same way the scriptures treat the great figures of the past - let&rsquo;s recognize the good they did, recognize where they went wrong, and recognize that the true hero of the story is God working through them and then let&rsquo;s worship Him.</p>
