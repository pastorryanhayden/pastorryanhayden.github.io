<h2 id="areevangelistsbiblical">Are Evangelists Biblical? Yes and No.</h2></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ&rdquo;</em> Ephesians 4:11&ndash;13</blockquote></p>
<h3 id="yes.">Yes.</h3><br />
The word &ldquo;evangelist&rdquo; is a Bible word. In the passage above, evangelists was one of the offices that God gave to the church so that the church could be edified.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;evangelist&rdquo; is found two other times in the New Testament. Once in Acts 21:8, Phillip (one of the original deacons) was called &ldquo;Philip the evangelist&rdquo;. Another time, in 2 Timothy 4:5, Paul told Timothy to do &ldquo;the work of an evangelist.&rdquo; So no one is going to deny that the word &ldquo;evangelist&rdquo; is a Bible word.</p>
<p>But what does that word mean? Unfortunately, there is no passage of scripture that defines that word. The few passages of scripture that we do have (the ones mentioned above with Philipp and Timothy) give us just a little insight into what an &ldquo;evangelist&rdquo; is. Philipp was a deacon who travelled around preaching the gospel (Samaria, the Ethiopian eunuch.) The passage in Timothy assumes we know what an evangelist is and offers no real insight.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-01-at-11.03.05-AM.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-827" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-01 at 11.03.05 AM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-01-at-11.03.05-AM-209x300.png" width="125" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>So we look at the word itself. The word evangelist is actually a transliterated word (There is no English word for it, so we just bring the greek word into english.). <em>Evangelizzo</em> means &ldquo;one who preaches the gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here is what we can take from the scriptures on the word &ldquo;evangelist.&rdquo; It probably refers to either a missionary or a specialist in preaching the gospel to others.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="no.">No.</h3><br />
90% of the time someone refers to themselves as an &ldquo;evangelist&rdquo; they are not referring to being a missionary or to being a specialist in evangelism. Most of the time, &ldquo;evangelist&rdquo; is a substitute for &ldquo;itinerant revivalist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are some Baptist evangelists who are in fact evangelists. They are the ones who are either going from church to church and teaching people how to evangelize or the ones who go to unchurched areas, set up a tent in a public place and start trying to win the lost to Christ. These men (and I know several of them) are a valuable asset to our churches. But these men are the exception, not the rule. Most independent Baptist &ldquo;evangelists&rdquo; are in fact &ldquo;revivalists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And here is the thing. Read that list at the beginning of the post again.</p>
<ul>
<li>God gave the church <strong>apostles</strong> (I&rsquo;d say that office has ceased.)</li>
<li>God gave us <strong>prophets</strong> (again, I&rsquo;d say that office has ceased with the completion of the Word of God.)</li>
<li>He gave us <strong>evangelists</strong> (see above)</li>
<li>He gave us <strong>pastors</strong> and teachers.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Notice <strong>revivalist</strong> wasn&rsquo;t on the list.</p>
<p>Now we are in a quandary. <strong>Either God knows what He is doing or He does not. Either God describes what the church should be doing or He does not.</strong> Anything that we add to God&rsquo;s plan for the church needs to be treated with caution.</p>
<h3 id="butwhatabout">But what about?</h3><br />
So is it wrong for church leaders to bring in an outside preacher to teach their church something or for special meetings? <strong>Absolutely not.</strong></p>
<p>The church I pastor had, for many years, an &ldquo;evangelist conference&rdquo; where many outside speakers would come in to preach. Most, if not all, of those men were great Christians with legitimate Bible teaching ministries. Some of them have befriended me since my coming here and I&rsquo;m grateful for their friendship. I know many people who consider themselves evangelists that I would love to have come to our church. <strong>This post is in no way intended to defame or devalue the many who have called themselves &ldquo;evangelists&rdquo; over the years.</strong></p>
<p>But shouldn&rsquo;t we label those people biblically? Either they are a biblical evangelist, primarily tasked with winning the lost or they are a visiting pastor or itinerant teacher.</p>
<p>Those distinctions are important because both <em>pastors</em> and <em>teachers</em> (as well as one definition of evangelists) will be authoritatively <strong>teaching</strong> people the Word of God. They won&rsquo;t see their job to be whipping people up into an emotional frenzy or bringing on some post-salvation crisis. They will see themselves as bringing people into alignment with what the Bible says a Christian should be and helping people to grow in grace.</p>
<p>Words mean something. We wouldn&rsquo;t want people redefining Bible words like "grace", "faith" and "all". Let&rsquo;s not allow history to redefine the Bible word &ldquo;evangelist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s emphasize what the Bible emphasizes.</p>
