<p>Dr. Goddard,</p>
<p>I read <a href="http://oldpathsjournal.com/2014/06/20/the-relevancy-of-the-old-paths/">the article you put out recently in the oldpaths journal</a>, and because that journal has no place for comments, I&rsquo;m posting mine here:</p>
<p>Your article seems to be aimed at refuting young independent baptist pastors, who have a blog, and who have been critical of the buzzword &ldquo;oldpaths.&rdquo; In other words, your article seemed to be aimed squarely at me. Thanks for that.</p>
<p>Here are some of the nice things you said about me (or people like me) in your article:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We sit in a generation of do nothings who want everyone to listen to them criticize those who went before, those who accomplished great things for God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our generation criticizes the founding fathers, and young foolish preachers likewise criticize the great spiritual founders who gave us the foundation of our churches today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was not some &lsquo;wanna be preacher,&rsquo; but an old gristled veteran, a man who was proven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These new kids with their mocking of the old paths just don&rsquo;t impress me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today there were some who simply didn&rsquo;t want to walk in the old paths. They&rsquo;ve made excuses. They are so full of self and new ideas that they cannot fathom their peers listening to the ideas of older men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great men all preached on &ldquo;OLD PATHS,&rdquo; and I will trust what they said about &ldquo;OLD PATHS&rdquo; a lot more than some rookie who has more followers on Facebook than in his church.</blockquote><br />
So I&rsquo;m a do nothing, foolish, wanna be preacher who is full of self and new ideas, who can&rsquo;t fathom anybody seeking advice from older men, and who has more followers on Facebook than in his church. Can I put that on a plaque?</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I think there are three fatal flaws in your article:</p>
<h1>First, you are attacking a mischaracterization.</h1><br />
I&rsquo;m sure there are guys out there, hiding behind some parody account on twitter and having a grand old time mocking things like soul-winning, separation, respect for elders, authority, ect.. They just aren&rsquo;t pastoring Independent Baptist churches. But I am. So let&rsquo;s get this straight:</p>
<p>You seem to have this&nbsp;mental picture of any preacher who doesn&rsquo;t like the &ldquo;oldpaths&rdquo; buzzword:</p>
<ul>
<li>they have no respect for elders or for the fathers of fundamentalism</li>
<li>whenever they need advice in the ministry they call another 30 something year old pastor</li>
<li>they are people with no personal standards of separation, who have no desire to see souls saved, and who want to open the floodgates of hell into their church.</li><br />
</ul><br />
I&rsquo;m sorry, but it&rsquo;s a ridiculous picture.</p>
<p>I have an immense amount of respect for men like John R. Rice, Lee Roberson, Carl McIntire, Bob Ketchum, Oliver B. Green, Harold Sightler and R.G. Lee. I&rsquo;ve studied the genesis of the fundamentalism and later the independent Baptist movement, and I applaud and greatly admire the men who paid a heavy price for taking their stand and for leaving the conventions.</p>
<p><strong>But these men didn&rsquo;t present a united front</strong> and would hardly fit into the &ldquo;oldpaths&rdquo; movement of today. John R. Rice was not King James only. Lee Roberson had many evangelicals (like Warren Weirsbe) come and speak at Tennessee Temple. Carl McIntire was a presbyterian. Bob Ketchum was a mild calvinist who started his own quasi-convention. Oliver B. Green and Harold Sightler were both strong Bible preachers who favored expository preaching. R. G. Lee was a &ldquo;stay inner.&rdquo; We could, no doubt, find many other areas where they disagreed among themselves and would disagree with the modern incarnation of the &ldquo;oldpaths&rdquo; movement. So it&rsquo;s hardly fair to use them collectively as a weapon for enforcing IFB uniformity.</p>
<p>They also espoused some things that I don't think anyone would want to preach today. &nbsp;Rice stood against racial desegregation. &nbsp;W. B. Riley tried propagating the "protocols of Israel myth." &nbsp;Frank Norris praised Hitler (before World War II.) &nbsp;Are we not allowed to have varying opinions from these OLD PATHS preachers about those things?</p>
<p>One thing that they were uniform on though, is their <strong>resistance to control</strong>. Read about John R. Rice refusing the commands of the SBC to disassociate with Frank Norris, and then later disassociating with Norris because Norris was trying to control him and tell me there wasn&rsquo;t a young preacher who <strong>resisted outside control of his ministry</strong>. Or how about Lee Roberson starting his own missions board and college despite the prohibition of the older preachers in the convention&nbsp;and tell me he wasn&rsquo;t independent. I could go on.</p>
<p>You also compared your target to Rehoboam, and said that these young preachers can&rsquo;t stand to see their peers going to older men for advice. Really? Do you think that young pastors aren&rsquo;t hungry for the advice of older men? I can&rsquo;t speak for all younger pastors, but I can say that when I need advice, almost every man on my call list is over 70. There are three other independent Baptist churches in my town, and yet mine has three retired pastors in it. &nbsp;That's hardly the sign of a Rehoboam.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest indication that you are aiming at the wrong target is your idea that young pastors critical of &ldquo;oldpaths&rdquo; are actually critical of &ldquo;the old paths&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s just not true. Nothing in my original article on old paths would give the idea that I&rsquo;m against the time honored traditions of historical Christianity. I took issue to the nebulous nature of the &ldquo;old paths&rdquo; buzzword and to the way it was used to bully young preachers. That&rsquo;s it. <a title="My Attempt At Defining the True #OldPaths." href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/attempt-defining-true-oldpaths/">I even wrote an article trying to define what I see as the old paths worth fighitng for.</a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one of the things your article get&rsquo;s wrong&hellip;</p>
<h1>Second, you twisted scripture.</h1><br />
I&rsquo;m not going to develop this, but in your opening paragraphs you tried to make a biblical argument for &ldquo;following great leaders&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s obvious that your idea of &ldquo;following great leaders&rdquo; means never criticizing their actions or policies. Do you really believe that God intends for every generation to take what the generation before has given them and pass it on unaltered to the next generation? That&rsquo;s how we got the Roman Catholic church. There wouldn&rsquo;t be an IFB movement if people like Hyles, Rice, Roberson and company had done that.</p>
<p>Sure, there are 1 Cor. 16:15-16s and Rehoboam stories in the Bible, but there are also Josiah stories, and Samuel stories, and stories of young men like Jeremiah. There were Elishas whose ministry was nothing like the Elijahs they followed. There are Nathans who pointed there fingers at Davids and there are Bereans who wouldn&rsquo;t just take Paul&rsquo;s word for it, but searched the scriptures. There are Paul&rsquo;s who were willing to withstand Peters to the face.</p>
<p>So the doctrine that &ldquo;following great men&rdquo; equals &ldquo;following great men blindly and making a carbon copy of their ministry model&rdquo; is a doctrine foreign to the scripture.</p>
<p>One more thing&hellip;</p>
<h1>Third, you tipped your cards.</h1><br />
You said</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The fact is, in my lifetime &ldquo;OLD PATHS&rdquo; means John Rice, Jack Hyles, Lee Roberson and others.&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
<strong>So you just&nbsp;admitted&nbsp;that &ldquo;OLD PATHS&rdquo; equals 1960-1980s paths</strong>. These men were still at the peak of their ministries when Happy Days was airing, not just during the Happy Days. Jack Hyles was still pastoring FBC Hammond when the Power Rangers was on TV and the year&nbsp;Windows XP was released. &nbsp;Is that really "OLD PATHS?"</p>
<p>But what do we do when we realize that the ministry philosophy of Hyles, Rice and Roberson differed seriously from the ministry philosophy of faithful &ldquo;seasoned&rdquo; preachers of the generation before, or the generation before that? What about Shubal Stearns, Charles Spurgeon, AJ Gordon, Harry Ironside, R.A. Torrey, F. B. Meyer, Campbell Morgan, James Stewart, etc.? Are they not also &ldquo;OLD PATHS&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just call a spade a spade: &ldquo;OLD PATHS&rdquo; has become the new &ldquo;100% for Hyles.&rdquo; Look.&nbsp;Your article was printed in the Oldpathsjournal, which is a ministry of Bob Gray&rsquo;s church and which is edited by an evangelist formerly on staff for Jeff Owens. 90% of the preachers who promote &ldquo;OLD PATHS&rdquo; are leftovers of the extreme end of the Hyles crowd.</p>
<p>Here is what it comes down to: I&rsquo;m all for soul winning, traditional ministry, the bus ministry, church planting, missions, ecclesiastical and personal serparation, our fundamental heritage, etc. BUT I&rsquo;M NOT WEARING THAT BUTTON.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a repudiation of all older preachers, of the old time religion, or of the true old paths - its a repudiation of the small number of older preachers who have hijacked and redefined the term.</p>
