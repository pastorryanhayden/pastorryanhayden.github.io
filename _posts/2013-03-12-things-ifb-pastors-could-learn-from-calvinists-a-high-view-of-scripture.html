<p>This week I'm writing about "Things IFB pastors could learn from the Calvinists." &nbsp;I'm not a calvinist. &nbsp;Been there, done that, bought the T-shirt. &nbsp;While I don't think hard core calvinism is Biblical or healthy, I think that calvinists have a lot to teach us.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a lot of the young guys who are going "calvi" probably wouldn't if we'd learn these things.</p>
<p>You can read my <a title="Things Independent Baptists Could Learn From Calvinists." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/things-independent-baptists-could-learn-from-calvinists/">introduction here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="ahighviewofscripture.">1. A high view of scripture.</h1><br />
Thankfully, there has been a big move in IFB circles towards biblical preaching in the last few years. When I was in college, Clarence Sexton hammered time and again on the theme of <strong>&ldquo;A Revolution Back to the Bible,&rdquo;</strong> our homiletics course was solid, and I heard the phrase &ldquo;place an emphasis where scripture places an emphasis&rdquo; more times than I care to count. But this isn&rsquo;t just something happening in Crown College land, <a href="http://preaching.lancasterbaptist.org/sermons/slc-2012-tuesday-evening-pastor-kurt-skelly">Kurt Skelley preached a great message</a> on Biblical Preaching at last years Spiritual Leadership Conference in Lancaster, CA and Paul Chappell has been investing his enormous influence among independent Baptists in the cause of expository preaching.</p>
<p><em><strong>This is a great thing. But it&rsquo;s also a fairly new thing.</strong></em></p>
<p>For many years, Independent Baptists were not champions of Biblical preaching. Revivalism, moralism, and pragmatism pushed the Bible out of the pulpit. Some of the most famous sermons from IFB leaders in the 70s and 80s have almost nothing to do with the text from which they supposedly came and some IFB leaders (like Jack Hyles) openly mocked expository preaching. Many of us young guys grew up in a church context where the Bible was regularly (if not purposely) abused.</p>

<p>I can remember driving home from work as a college freshman and hearing the Bible preaching ministry of John MacArthur. I&rsquo;d never heard anybody so clearly teach the Bible and I&rsquo;d never heard any preaching so obviously derived from and tied to the text. I soaked it up. Then I looked at some of the Independent Baptists I was hearing from time to time and while they talked a big game about the Bible, and maybe even made us stand for a minute while they read it, they weren&rsquo;t really paying it the attention that MacArthur was. &nbsp;(Please don't read this as a promotion of John MacArthur. &nbsp;He has always been a mixed bag, and he does teach some dangerous ideas.)</p>
<p>We are coming back to the emphasizing of scripture. But here is the thing about Calvinists: they never left it. For decades people like MacArthur and Piper were expository preachers when that wasn&rsquo;t popular. Calvinists have always been champions of biblical inherency and sufficiency and still are today.</p>
<p>Most calvinists that I know don&rsquo;t look to scripture for a proof text, they study the scripture and try to teach what it says. I disagree with some of their conclusions, but they are right on in their methods.</p>
<p>We Independent Baptists need to get back to Bible preaching.<em><strong> If fundamentalism is a battle over what the Bible teaches, then what is more fundamental than Bible preaching?</strong></em> If we really care about being people of the book, let&rsquo;s stop whacking it and slapping it and pulling out verses that support our hobby-horse-of-the-week and lets start studying it and finding it&rsquo;s emphasis and bringing people the Word of God.</p>
<p>This has got to get to be so big to us that it&rsquo;s a <em><strong>separating issue</strong></em>. We can&rsquo;t leave it again.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.&rdquo;</em> (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/2Timothy3%3A16-17" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">2 Timothy 3:16&ndash;17</a>)</blockquote><br />
Here&rsquo;s the thing that happens when you have a high view of scripture. A lot of our shallow IFB baggage goes out the window. You cannot study the scripture, I mean really study it, without it changing and challenging your ideas. You cannot come to it with a shallow view of salvation, of sanctification, or of separation and hope to keep that shallow view. You might just find out that your views on a lot of things don&rsquo;t come right from the Word. That&rsquo;s a scary, but worthwhile endeavor.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.&rdquo;</em> (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/James1%3A25" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">James 1:25</a>)</blockquote><br />
Tomorrow, I'll be writing about how calvinists aren't afraid of doctrine.</p>
<p>Fire away.</p>
