<p>When I was around 15, my parents called me into the kitchen for one of our regular late night discussions. &nbsp;Only this time, I wasn&rsquo;t the one in trouble. &nbsp;We had just left a church where we were extremely involved and they informed me, the oldest child, that the man who had been my pastor had decided to leave his wife of over thirty years and run away with the church secretary, who was a close family friend.<br />
I had idolized that pastor. &nbsp;I can remember volunteering to shovel snow just to spend time in his office looking at all of the nice furniture and paintings. I can remember being in awe of the &ldquo;Dr.&rdquo; nameplate on the door. &nbsp;I can remember cheering for him when our church had great revival meetings and friends of ours trusted Christ. &nbsp;He was my hero, but in the end he proved to be a pitiful hero.</p>
<p>Years before that I had had another pastor who I idolized. &nbsp;This one told awesome stories in his sermons about his military exploits. &nbsp;His son was my boyhood best friend. &nbsp;Decades later his church learned that all of the stories had been made up and the military history he used as the backbone of his sermon illustrations was&nbsp;an elaborate lie.</p>
<p>The truth is, I shouldn&rsquo;t be an independent Baptist today. &nbsp;Many of the people I went to church with in those churches could not survive the scandal and either stopped going to church entirely or went to a totally different kind of church. &nbsp;A large group of them went to another independent Baptist church where a few years later, their pastor, another larger than life character, did essentially the same thing (leave his wife for a church member.)</p>
<p>But I am an independent baptist. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m an independent Baptist in large part because of other men. &nbsp;Truly great men who had the humility to meet me where I was and help me. &nbsp;These guys weren&rsquo;t perfect and never pretended to be, but they cared about me, faithfully preached to me, and mentored me. &nbsp;They answered uncomfortable questions, sometimes agreed to disagree and consistently showed that they cared. &nbsp;They took a spiritual towel and washed my spiritual feet. &nbsp;They were great because of their humility and their willingness to serve. &nbsp;I do and probably always will revere these men. They were and are my inspirations as a pastor. To use some Bible language, I count them worthy of double honor. &nbsp;But I will honor them <i>as men</i>.</p>
<p>There are thousands of independent Baptists in this country who have seen the other side of great men. &nbsp;They had pastors with national esteem who broke their marriage vows, who were caught stealing from a church, whose life ended in sudden suicide or who did something even more scandalous - molested children. &nbsp;Their faith in the greatness of great men is forever shattered.</p>
<p>But when you listen to or read the sermons, tweets and articles by many independent Baptist leaders who push on us &ldquo;great men&rdquo; these people aren&rsquo;t even acknowledged. Instead, anyone who questions the perfection of great men is called a scorner, a critic, or someone with &ldquo;neo-lean.&rdquo; &nbsp; Anybody with even the slightest of reservations about heralding &ldquo;great men&rdquo; constantly is treated as a dangerous player on the other team.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to a strong opinion about the &ldquo;great men&rdquo; crowd: &nbsp;<b>They don&rsquo;t really REVERE&nbsp;great men - they USE&nbsp;great men.</b> &nbsp;They need these great men to advance their agenda. &nbsp;They need these great men to insulate themselves from criticism and having to think for themselves. &nbsp;They need these great men to justify what they are doing. &nbsp;So they USE&nbsp;them. &nbsp;They whittle down their lives to an agenda and they travel the country beating people over the head with it in the name of revering &ldquo;great men."</p>
<p>The man who Jesus said was <strong>the greatest man who had ever lived</strong> had this philosophy <i>&ldquo;He&nbsp;must&nbsp;increase, but I&nbsp;must&nbsp;decrease.&rdquo;</i> (John 3:30) He didn&rsquo;t go around pointing to how great he was or boasting of the number of baptisms he had in the Jordan river - he directed people&rsquo;s attention to the truly Great Man saying <i>&ldquo;Behold&nbsp;the&nbsp;Lamb&nbsp;of&nbsp;God, which taketh away&nbsp;the&nbsp;sin&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;world.&rdquo; </i>(John 1:29)</p>
<p>After telling us about the faith of great men in Hebrews 11, the author of Hebrews brings it to a close by telling us to look, not to those great men, but...</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of&nbsp;our&nbsp;faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hebrews 12:2</blockquote><br />
I&rsquo;m grateful for the testimony of those who have gone before. &nbsp;My bookshelf is stocked with biographies of men like Hudson Taylor, D.L. Moody, G. Campbell Morgan, John R. Rice, Charles Spurgeon and many, many others. &nbsp;These men are witnesses cheering us on in our walk.</p>
<p>But I have a strong feeling they aren&rsquo;t saying &ldquo;look at me, look at me, look at me. &nbsp;Look at what I did. &nbsp;No. Look a little closer.&rdquo; &nbsp;I think they are saying &ldquo;look to Him."</p>
<p>After all - if they were great, it was because they were <em>like Him</em>. &nbsp;If they were great it was because they <em>deflected peoples attention to Him</em>. &nbsp;Great men will let you down. &nbsp;<em>Jesus never will. &nbsp;</em></p>
