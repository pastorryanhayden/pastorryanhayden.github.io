<div style="color: #000000;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Tonight, my social media feed is ablaze with headlines like &ldquo;Supreme Court rules that bosses can deny <span id="6c6eb933-55bd-4cbd-83c3-e744e5664d3c" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="99ec291f-5196-4871-8e94-01cad6d5b8bf" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">employees</span></span> coverage of birth control" and quips like &ldquo;Hobby Lobby: a fun place to&nbsp;buy&nbsp;beads and support the religious oppression of women&rdquo; and &nbsp; So,&nbsp;to calm the rage of my liberal friends and assuage the fear of oppression fearing women everywhere - I&rsquo;d like to try to dispel three myths about this case you might be believing.</span></div></p>
<div style="color: #000000;"></div></p>
<h2 style="color: #000000;">Myth Number 1 - This case was over a minor thing.</h2></p>
<div style="color: #000000;"><span class="mceItemHidden">After World War 2, the allies tried many lowly German soldiers&nbsp;for crimes against humanity. &nbsp;One pressing legal question that came out of that was &ldquo;How can you punish people for following orders?&rdquo; &nbsp;The answer -&nbsp;<span class="hiddenSuggestion">rather than</span>&nbsp;kill innocents, those soldiers should have had the moral backbone to resist the orders of their government. &nbsp;</span></div></p>
<div style="color: #000000;">That is an exact parallel to Hobby Lobby. &nbsp;The owners of Hobby Lobby believe (whether rightly or wrongly) that providing certain kinds of contraceptives is akin to providing poison pills for their employees to kill their children. &nbsp;In other words, they believe that it is being a party to murder. &nbsp;Being forced into what you believe is murder is no trivial concern. &nbsp; Rather than <span id="255f0bc9-c661-4b4e-a97f-fc97491edd89" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">be</span> a part of killing innocents, they had the moral backbone to resist their orders, and the Supreme Court has vindicated them.</div></p>
<h2 style="color: #000000;">Myth Number 2 - This was about money.</h2></p>
<div style="color: #000000;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Here&rsquo;s what everyone seems&nbsp;<span class="hiddenGrammarError">to be</span>&nbsp;saying: The Greens (the owners of Hobby Lobby) are just a bunch of greedy capitalists too cheap to pay for contraceptives. &nbsp;Nothing could be further than the truth. &nbsp;The contraceptive mandate requires they pay for 16 various forms of contraception and Hobby Lobby happily pays for 15. &nbsp;They are only opposed to the&nbsp;so-called&ldquo;morning after&rdquo; pill. &nbsp;Hobby Lobby has not opposed nor tried to buck the <span id="42ac090a-1e5b-42ae-b1f3-1f47eae17ce3" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">governments</span> general&nbsp;<span class="hiddenSuggestion">requirement</span>&nbsp;that they pay for contraception. Think about this, if a company <span id="3c9fe8ca-dc6c-43f2-930c-7ed17054bad2" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">is willingly paying</span> for $30 a month birth control pills and $3,000 female sterilization procedures, what business sense does it make for them to risk hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and a costly legal battle so they don&rsquo;t have to buy a $15 pill only a small segment of their workforce would use only rarely? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s obvious that this was a risky decision made on conscience alone.</span></div></p>
<h2 style="color: #000000;">Myth Number 3 - a corporation can&rsquo;t have a conscience.</h2></p>
<div style="color: #000000;">Let&rsquo;s reverse this. Let&rsquo;s say the government decided to mandate that homosexual couples could not receive marriage benefits. Would there not be companies (like Google or Starbucks) who conscientiously opposed that law? Would we expect those companies to stand for their corporate values? The same first amendment&nbsp;that guarantees&nbsp;religious freedom also&nbsp;guarantees&nbsp;freedom of the press. &nbsp;Would we argue that the New York Times has no right to free speech protection because it's a corporation? &nbsp;Of course not.</div></p>
<div style="color: #000000;"></div></p>
<div style="color: #000000;">There's a lot of myths out there, but make no mistake about it - this case was about the right of religious people to follow their conscience, even in business. &nbsp;Thankfully, that right was upheld. &nbsp;Unfortunately, there is a cadre of people who want their definition of progress and don't care who they have to step on to get it. &nbsp;The Supreme Court stood in their way today. &nbsp;They are not taking it well.</div></p>
