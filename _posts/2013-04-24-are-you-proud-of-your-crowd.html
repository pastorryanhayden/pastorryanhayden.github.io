<p>In the middle of <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians4" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 4</a>, the apostle Paul launches on the most sarcastic rebuke recorded in scripture. What was he rebuking in this Corinthian church? Was it there bad views of spiritual gifts? their immorality? their lack of charity?</p>
<p>No. He was rebuking their arrogance. And not just any arrogance, a certain kind of arrogance: arrogance centered in their religious affiliation.</p>
<p><strong>They were proud of their crowd.</strong></p>
<p>Fast forward to today. If I had a dollar every time I&rsquo;ve heard a preacher throw out the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an Independent Bible believing Baptist,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fundamental, independent militant Bible believing baptist&rdquo; or my personal favorite &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an independent fundamental biscuit eating baptist&rdquo; (or any of the hundreds of variants) my church gym would have wood floors.</p>
<p>But what are we doing when we pepper our sermons with those kind of statements? (besides trying to get a response from the crowd?) <strong>Are we not boasting?</strong> Is not the subtext of those statements. <strong>I am better than anybody else. We are better than they are.</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians4" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 4</a>, pride in your religious crowd is NOT a good thing. (This, like preacher worship, is another thing scripture condemns that we have turned into a virtue.)</p>
<p>In dealing with this problem in the Corinthian church, Paul asked the Corinthians three questions in verse 7:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
Let&rsquo;s look at each of these one by one&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="whomakeththeetodifferfromanother">Who maketh thee to differ from another?</h2><br />
The first thing Paul asks them could be paraphrased &ldquo;who do you think you are?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What makes you any better than anybody else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking across the religious landscape, I&rsquo;m sure that if we are honest we can answer that question. We might say our adherence to the Bible makes us better or our theological heritage or our soul winning zeal. Those are all good things. We should be grateful for them.</p>
<p>But if you talk to a Southern Baptist or an Orthodox Presbyterian, or a member of a Bible Church, they also have those things to be proud of. In some areas, they&rsquo;ve managed to stay clear of the theological errors found in OUR movement. They might be looking at us and saying "bless God, we don&rsquo;t turn our pastors into rock stars who are above any rebuke or accountability, we take hermeneutics seriously, etc.)</p>
<h2 id="whathastthouthatthoudidstnotreceive">What hast thou that thou didst not receive?</h2><br />
This is an interesting question. Think about it? What do we have, that we haven&rsquo;t received?</p>
<p>I did an informal poll in my church and asked them to answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many of you were born into an independent baptist church or grew up in one?</li>
<li>How many of you married into an independent baptist church?</li>
<li>How many of you were saved in an independent baptist church?</li><br />
</ul><br />
In my small church, that accounted for everyone. Not one of our members could say they were independent baptists primarily because they chose it. It chose them. God put them there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are some of us who chose to become independent baptists out of some other religious context, but they are few. Even so, all of us were led here providentially.</p>
<h2 id="whydostthougloryasifthouhadstnotreceivedit">Why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?</h2><br />
This last question is about the same as saying &ldquo;If you were born on third base, why are you acting like you hit a home run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fair question isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I am an independent Baptist by conviction. I&rsquo;m not going anywhere. I&rsquo;m grateful that God put me here.</p>
<p>Gratitude doesn&rsquo;t lend to boasting. Pride does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about me and my accomplishments and my stand. It&rsquo;s about God and His work in my life.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stay humble and grateful about where God put us. Let&rsquo;s be patient with those who are not where we are, and try to take into account their religious context (where God put them.) <strong>Let&rsquo;s not be proud of our crowd.</strong></p>
