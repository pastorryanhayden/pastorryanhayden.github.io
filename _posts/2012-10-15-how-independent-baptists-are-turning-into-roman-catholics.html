<p><strong><em>Independent Baptists are turning into Roman Catholics.&nbsp;</em></strong> It may be true that for the moment our churches are void of candles, rosaries, confession boxes and nuns, but we are currently making the same two mistakes that led the Catholic church into those errors and which have led most of the Protestant denominations into their current pitiful state.&nbsp; The process is is already started.&nbsp; It may take some time, but sooner than later, Independent Baptist churches will, just like the Catholics and Protestants, start to look less and less like the church of the Bible and more and more like a caricature. What are those two mistakes?</p></p>
<h3>Replacing the Bible with rituals</h3></p>
<p>Where did rosary beads, confession boxes, nuns and the Eucharist come from?&nbsp; First, a very long time ago the Catholics took some hint, some part of a principle from scripture, and they ran with it; turning it into a rule or ritual.&nbsp; Pray without ceasing - beads.&nbsp; Confess your faults one to another - boxes.&nbsp; Take eat this is my body - Eucharist.&nbsp; At their genesis, all of these practices sprang from an impulse to make biblical Christianity easier to live out by creating some extra-biblical rules and practices based on Bible principles. Over time, those practices completely lost their meaning.&nbsp; They became an end in themselves.&nbsp; Only a few Catholics can point to biblical reasons for why they pray over a rosary or go to confession or take the Eucharist, but they all keep on doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The simple and external nature of a ritual makes it very easy to copy and very easy to pass on. Roman Catholics don't need clear Bible teaching.&nbsp; They went for many hundreds of years listening to priest teach in a language few of them understood.&nbsp; How can you fill a church with people who have no idea what is going on?&nbsp; The answer: give them rituals; that's all they need.&nbsp; The rituals have replaced biblical orthodoxy.&nbsp; The rituals have become their religion. Independent Baptists are making this same fundamental mistake and have been for years.&nbsp; We are creating rituals and elevating them over the Bible.&nbsp; We never set out to do this.&nbsp; It wasn't anybody's goal.&nbsp; But it is happening nonetheless. Consider the emphasis on "standards."&nbsp; It is a term found no where in the Bible.&nbsp; No where in scripture is there anything even close to the kind of moral and cultural checklist that standards has become for many people.&nbsp; As a reaction to changes in culture, a bunch of fundamentalist leaders made mountains of biblical molehills and created a list of rules.&nbsp; For far too many people, those rules have completely lost their biblical meaning and unfortunately, for many, have replaced the meaning of the Bible.&nbsp; "Standards" has become a ritual just like rosary beads and confession boxes. Consider these other Independent baptist "rituals", all of them have little or no biblical support, but they define orthodoxy for many, many people:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>a revivalistic preaching style</li>
<li>the altar call system</li>
<li>"amens" and shouting</li>
<li>visitation programs</li>
<li>etc. Personally, I don't think any of things I listed are wrong in and of themselves, but they can easily become rituals, and as rituals they will eventually replace for people what the Bible says because it's far easier to lean on a ritual than it is to study the Bible, have a relationship with God, and live a holy life. </li><br />
</ul></p>
<h3>Lifting up men to extra-biblical authority</h3></p>
<p>The other mistake that led the catholic church to become what it is today is lifting up men to extra-biblical authority.&nbsp; It wasn't enough to create rituals, the rituals had to be affirmed by men who had God's authority.&nbsp; By lifting up a few men to extreme levels of authority, they squashed any chance for biblical reform.&nbsp; After all, if God's man affirms the ritual, than it must be right. Independent Baptists might not have cardinals, councils, popes or priests, but we do have a tendency to lift up a few men to extreme levels of authority and accept their words as above question.&nbsp; There are many independent baptists today who need no other argument or defense for their religion than "Dr. Hyles did it" or "John R. Rice said it was o.k.."&nbsp; The leadership of a few men thus becomes the plausibility structure for rituals.&nbsp; If God's man affirms it, it has to be right. Along that same line, there are several popular preachers that consider themselves "the pastor" of other local church pastors around the country.&nbsp; I guess it is o.k. for us pastors to look to God blessed preachers for leadership from afar, but if we look to them for pastoral authority, aren't we just recreating the office of an apostle?&nbsp; As a cessationist, I believe that God's Word was "that which was perfect" and it did away with, among other things, the need for the office of the apostle.&nbsp; I believe that if we need authority beyond the local church level we are to look into God's perfect word.&nbsp; This subtle idea of "a pastor's pastor" endangers that and could lead to bigger problems.</p></p>
<h3>So how do we fix it?</h3></p>
<p>If Independent Baptists have started down the slope towards ritualism and extra-biblical authority figures, how do stop their rolling and get them back up the hill?&nbsp; The answer is simple: we just go back to preaching the Bible. If standards, revivalism, shouting amen, altar calls, national leaders, or whatever else has become orthodoxy to Independent Baptists is what God intended, then it follows that if we just preach the book that He gave us honestly and carefully, then all of those things will be affirmed.&nbsp; If in preaching the Bible those things aren't affirmed, then it follows that God has another plan for the church and His people. If we can't hold our religion to the test of the Bible, then we've already lost the war and we are headed towards our own kind of Catholic idolatry faster than we care to think.</p></p>
