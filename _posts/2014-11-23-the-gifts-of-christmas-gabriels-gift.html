<p><i>Every Sunday Morning, I post my sermon manuscript here. &nbsp;I know most people don&rsquo;t have time to read a full manuscript, and I also know that these manuscripts will defnitely have even more spelling and grammar errors in them than my normal blog posts, but I&rsquo;m going to post them here anyway in the hope that they can help someone. &nbsp;This is the second message in a series titled:&nbsp;<b>The Gifts of Christmas</b>. &nbsp;We will resume Ephesians in January.<br></i><br>Last Sunday, I started a series called &ldquo;the gifts of that first Christmas.&rdquo; We are looking at the first Christmas story, and we are looking at the contributions, or the gifts, of the different characters in the story. So last Sunday we discussed God and God&rsquo;s gift of his son.<br>Today we are going to look at some of the familiar human characters of the Christmas story - but the one I want to focus on isn&rsquo;t a human - but an angel.</p>
<p>Eventually, we&rsquo;ll be in Luke 1. But I want us to start off in the book of Malachi. Just turn to the first page in Matthew, and go back one page. We&rsquo;re going to look at Malachi 4.</p>
<p>Malachi, of course, is the last book in the Old Testament. It ends with a prophecy. Look at verse 5:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord; and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to the fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>Those are the last words in the Old Testament. The promise that God would send a special prophet who would prepare people for the coming of the Lord.</p>
<p>But I want you to remember something. You probably have a blank page in your Bible between Malachi and Matthew. Between the Old Testament and the New Testament. That blank page represents 400 years.</p>
<p>God gave this prophecy that this special prophet would come before the Messiah - and then nothing happened for 400 years.</p>
<p>Now, let me put that in perspective for you. 400 years ago. If anybody lived here in Illinois - they weren&rsquo;t white. They were native americans. In fact, four hundred years ago - there was exactly one town in what we now know of as the United States that had people in it - Jamestown. 400 years ago - the pilgrims were still 6 years from getting here.</p>
<p>Think about all that has happened in the last 400 years. I mean, for us, 400 years is ancient history. So if you were a jew living in Palestine at the time of the first Christmas - you&rsquo;ve got to think, God hasn&rsquo;t spoken to man for 400 years. There hasn&rsquo;t been a true prophet since ancient history. There hasn&rsquo;t been a miracle for four hundred years.</p>
<p>It was almost like God had abandoned his people. Like God had stopped working.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the setting for our story.</p>
<p>Now, with that in mind, turn to Luke 1. Luke 1. We are going to read verses 5-25.</p>
<p><strong><em>We are going to be reading a lot of scripture this morning, so let&rsquo;s just go ahead and pray and ask the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</em></strong></p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;<a href="">Luk 1:5-25 KJV</a> 5 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife <a href="">was</a> of the daughters of Aaron, and her name <a href="">was</a> Elisabeth. 6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. 7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were <a href="">now</a> well stricken in years. 8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course, 9 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. 10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. 11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.<br />
</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on here? Well, let me put try to explain that a little. </p>
<p>The passage says there was a certain priest named Zacharias. </p>
<p>Now, I want you to understand something about this guy - he was, at least in the eyes of the world - nothing special. He was just a certain priest. Literally, this passage could have been translated <em>&ldquo;there was some priest named Zacharias.&rdquo;</em> He wasn&rsquo;t the high priest. He didn&rsquo;t serve some special priestly political office. He was just a common priest who lived out in the country. An old guy, probably at least in his 60s maybe even older than that, who had never had any children. </p>
<p>During this time, there were 18,000 priests. 18,000. How many temples were there? 1. Ever heard the phrase &ldquo;too many cooks in the kitchen.&rdquo; Imagine 18,000 people all trying to do the same things at the temple at the same time. It would have been crazy. So they divided them up into 24 courses, and the priests would only serve two weeks a year. They would take turns and when they reported for duty, they would basically cast lots to see who got what job. It would be like going on army reserve duty, showing up and pulling your job for the month out of a hat. That&rsquo;s what they did.</p>
<p>So in this story Zacharias is on his annual two week duty, and he pulls an exciting job out of the hat. He gets to go into the holy place and altar incense. This was a big job, and important job. Unless you were the high priest - this was the closest you would ever get to the presence of God.</p>
<p>So their is this old priest, and he&rsquo;s at the temple doing his duty, and he gets the exciting, once in a lifetime job of going into the holy place and burning incense. He would be in there isolated - all by himself, while people watched outside and prayed.</p>
<p>And He&rsquo;s in there, and all of a sudden, the angel Gabriel comes in and starts talking to him.</p>
<p>Now remember, no one has seen an angel for 400 years. </p>
<p>So what happened. Well, look on at verse 12:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;12 And when Zacharias saw <a href="">him</a>, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. 13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. 14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. 16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. 17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>So the angel speaks up to Zacharias and here&rsquo;s how I imagine this conversation went: </p>
<p>Angel - &ldquo;Good news! You&rsquo;re prayers are answered!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Zacharias - Um? What Prayers?</p>
<p>Angel - Well, weren&rsquo;t you praying for a baby? </p>
<p>Zacharias - Yeah, like 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Angel - &ldquo;Well, you are going to have a baby, and not only are you going to have a baby, it&rsquo;s going to be the fulfillment of the last words of the Old Testament - He&rsquo;s going to be the special prophet that prepares people for the Messiah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, what would you have done? That was awesome news. I mean. Awesome news. The second greatest privilege a jewish parent could have would be to be the parent of this special prophet. (Obviously, Mary got the greatest privilege.) This was great news.</p>
<p>But it was also really hard to take. So look at what Zacharias says in verse 18&hellip; </p><br />
<blockquote>
<p> <em>&rdquo;18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I get out of that - I want a sign. I mean - I&rsquo;m too old to have kids. My wife is too old to have kids. We couldn&rsquo;t do it when we were young. Help me know I&rsquo;m not just hallucinating here.</p>
<p>So what does the angel say?</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p> <em>&rdquo;19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>Zacharias - I&rsquo;m not just any angel. I&rsquo;m Gabriel. I stand in God&rsquo;s very presence. I&rsquo;m one of two named angels in the whole Bible. Every super important message that God has for men - I deliver. </p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all the angel said:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p> <em>20 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. 21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple. 22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.<br />
</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>The angel took his speech away. He couldn&rsquo;t talk. Keep reading.</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house. 24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, 25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on <a href="">me</a>, to take away my reproach among men.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>So he&rsquo;s dumb. He can&rsquo;t speak. He serves out his two weeks, and goes home. Soon after, Elisabeth his wife miraculously is expecting a baby. Of course, that baby is born and it&rsquo;s John the Baptist and the rest is history.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the gift here? I could go a couple different directions with this but I want to talk about the gift of Gabriel in this passage. Gabriel the angel had the best news to give that has ever been given - this was the news that set off the events of the first Christmas. The long wait was over, the prophet was coming, he was coming from the most unlikely people and Jesus would be here soon.</p>
<p>So what can we learn from this story? I want to give you four thoughts very quickly in the time we have left:</p>
<p>I think the first thing we can learn from Gabriel&rsquo;s is&hellip; </p></p>
<h3 class="">1. Even when it seems God isn&rsquo;t working, He still has a plan.</h3></p>
<p>Many years ago I was going through one of my favorite stores - McCay&rsquo;s Used Books in Knoxville, TN. This is a huge barn sized bookstore just packed to the gills with used books and me and Amanda used to love to go there. Well, I was working through McCays and I remember picking up this book and looking at it. It was called &ldquo;the death of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought. That&rsquo;s blasphemous. That&rsquo;s terrible. But that&rsquo;s what a lot of people think about God - that He&rsquo;s dead. He may have created the world - but He&rsquo;s done with it. He wound it up like a clock and walked away to let it do it&rsquo;s own thing.</p>
<p>If there was ever a time in human history when it probably seemed like God was dead - like He was done working - it was the four hundred years before Jesus. For millennia He had been speaking to men. He had been working miracles. He had been guiding the jews. Then suddenly - He just stopped. It was all over. And it must have seemed like God was done. Like He&rsquo;d walked away.</p>
<p>I know some of you, maybe most of you, have gone through some time in your life when you thought &ldquo;God? Are you even there? Do you even care? How can you be in all this?&rdquo; You may not have said it out loud, but you started living like God wasn&rsquo;t active and wasn&rsquo;t a part of your life anymore.</p>
<p>But can I tell you something - and I think this Bible story is a good reminder of it - God is always working and God&rsquo;s timing is perfect.</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;All things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.&rdquo;</em> </p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>As a jew, Zacharias must have thought &ldquo;God, have you abandoned my people? Don&rsquo;t you care that we are in captivity?&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>As a Bible scholar he must have thought &ldquo;God, are your prophecies ever going to come true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a husband he must have thought &ldquo;God, don&rsquo;t you care that we don&rsquo;t have children? Don&rsquo;t you care that we have to watch all these other people have such joy in their lives as they raise their kids? Haven&rsquo;t we been faithful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe Zacharias was tempted to give up on God. But God was still working. God is always working, and His timing is always perfect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first lesson I think we should take from this.</p>
<p>The second thing we can get from the &ldquo;Gift of Gabriel&rdquo; is this:</p></p>
<h3 class="">2. God&rsquo;s plan, very often, isn&rsquo;t what we expect.</h3></p>
<p>God had been silent for 400 years and He chose to break His silence to who? To a common, elderly priest from the middle of nowhere!?</p>
<p>Huh? </p>
<p>I mean, wouldn&rsquo;t you think there would at least be trumpets involved? Maybe a really public miracle? Surely it would involve some very public display of God&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>Nope. Just an old guy from the middle of nowhere in a place where no one could see Him and verify his story. </p>
<p>And to make matters worse. He couldn&rsquo;t even tell his story. He was struck dumb. I guess he could write it - but I mean.</p>
<p>Church, this is not what people expected. Not even close.</p>
<p>How did God deliver the jews from famine? He sent Jacobs favorite son to be a slave in Egypt for years. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>When Israel needed a king, they chose the tallest, handsomest and strongest man they could find - God&rsquo;s choice was a shepherd boy. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Can I tell you something about God - He delights to do things from unexpected people in unexpected ways. We hear about these great moves of God from famous people like Billy Graham or Charles Spurgeon. But can I tell you something, God is just as likely to do his work through a little country church that no one has ever heard of that is faithful to the word. Or maybe through the faithful testimony of a mother. </p>
<p>Last Sunday night we heard from a missionary to Spain and He told the story of a little lady that was faithful to read her Bible on her lunch break. That lady testimony was instrumental to leading others to Christ and one of those she led to Christ became a missionary to Peru. They led someone to the Lord and now He and his children are missionaries in Spain and doing a good work for Christ.</p>
<p>We hear a lot about men like Charles Spurgeon - but there would never have been a Charles Spurgeon was it not for his pastor grandfather and pastor father both of whom labored their whole lifetimes in little churches that no one ever heard of.</p>
<p>Look, God doesn&rsquo;t need flashy. God doesn&rsquo;t need predictable. God&rsquo;s ways are not our ways.</p>
<p>Let me bring this to where you live. You might be thinking like Zacharias may have been thinking - my life is over - it&rsquo;s been such a waste. Nothing turned out like I&rsquo;d hoped. God must not care about me.</p>
<p>But I want to tell you - He&rsquo;s working. If you are faithful to Him - He&rsquo;s working. Just have faith. </p>
<p>Let me give you one more thought from this story:</p></p>
<h3 class="">3. Even the most faithful of people can become cynical about the work of God.</h3></p>
<p>Zacharias was a pretty faithful guy. Look at verse 6, where it says about Zacharias and Elisabeth:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments of God blameless.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>Zacharias was faithful, He was righteous, He was a servant of the Lord for his entire life.</p>
<p>You know, when He wasn&rsquo;t on his priestly duty, it wasn&rsquo;t like He was home for fifty weeks a year eating cheetos and watching the NFL. He was at home in his little village teaching the Bible and counseling. He was a faithful, devout, righteous servant of God and had been for a long time.</p>
<p>And yet, even when he was literally feet from God&rsquo;s presence. Even when He was doing the most spiritual job of his entire life, and even when God&rsquo;s personal messenger was standing right next to him - he still doubted God&rsquo;s plan and God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>Do you know what a cynic is? They are the person that can&rsquo;t trust anyone. You know we heard a lot of cynicism this week when President Obama announced his immigration policy. A lot of people said &ldquo;I know what he said he was going to do&hellip;but i don&rsquo;t trust him.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s cynicism.</p>
<p>We can all get cynical about what God is doing. We can all get cynical about God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know God&rsquo;s word says if we preach the gospel people will believe but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, all things work together for good but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It says Give and it shall be given unto you but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are cynical. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who you are, you can fall into this temptation.</p>
<p>So what do we make of this story? I&rsquo;ve told you it should remind us that God is always working, even when it seems like He isn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve told you that it should remind us that God&rsquo;s plan is often counterintuitive, and we&rsquo;ve seen that even faithful people can become cynical about God&rsquo;s work. </p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the theme running through all of this?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think it is: <b><u>trust God. </u></b></p>
<p>Just trust God. He&rsquo;s working. He&rsquo;s working when He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working. He&rsquo;s working in ways that don&rsquo;t make sense to us. He&rsquo;s working when we don&rsquo;t believe He is working. But He is working.</p>
<p>Just trust God. Take Him at His word, keep obeying HIm and He will do great things, even if they are quiet things, but great things with your life.</p></p>
<p><strong><em>Let&rsquo;s stand for invitation and prayer.</em></strong></p></p>
<p></p>
