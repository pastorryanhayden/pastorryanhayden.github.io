<p><i>I&rsquo;m going to start something new today. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to start posting my Sunday Morning Sermon Manuscript on here. &nbsp;I know most people don&rsquo;t have time to read a full manuscript, and I also know that these manuscripts will defnitely have even more spelling and grammar errors in them than my normal blog posts, but I&rsquo;m going to post them here anyway in the hope that they can help someone. &nbsp;Currently, we are going through a series in the book of Ephesians.<br></i></p><br />
<h1 class="">Put Off and Put On</h1><br />
<h4 class="">Ephesians 4:17-24</h4>
<p>Take your Bible&rsquo;s with me and turn again to Ephesians 4. Ephesians 4.</p>
<p>There are two great spiritual problems that everyone faces in life. The first one, is what the Philippian jailor asked the apostle Paul <strong>&ldquo;What must I do to be saved.&rdquo;</strong> It is the problem of <strong>Salvation</strong>.</p>
<p>The Bible teaches that all of us have a sin nature. A rebellious nature opposed to God. The consequences for that for every human being is death and what the Bible calls the second death, being cast into the lake of fire forever. That is not good news. That is, in fact, the most terrible news in the whole world.</p>
<p>So, we need to be saved from that. We need salvation.</p>
<p>The good news is that salvation is simple. When the man said to Paul &ldquo;What must I do to be saved?&rdquo; Paul didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;do good works.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;get baptized.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;attend the mass&rdquo; or &ldquo;take the eucharist.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The penalty for our sin was paid on the cross by the only perfect sacrifice - Jesus Christ, and all we must do to be saved is to believe on him as our Lord and Savior. Simply to take what He has done as true. </p>
<p>When we do that, we become born again. God makes us completely over from the inside out. He gives us a new nature. He replaces our stony heart with a heart to do His will. He makes us new.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem of salvation.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ve already been saved, there is a second great spiritual problem that all of us face - it&rsquo;s the problem of <strong>sanctification</strong>. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;What must I do to be saved?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s <strong>&ldquo;What must I do to be Christlike?&rdquo;</strong> or <strong>&ldquo;What must I do to stop sinning?&rdquo;</strong> </p>
<p>Our text this morning is the best text in the whole Bible on that subject. It&rsquo;s a very important portion of scripture. It&rsquo;s important because it gives us an answer to that second spiritual question. It&rsquo;s important because understanding it will keep us out of all kinds of spiritual trouble.</p>
<p>So lets read it. We&rsquo;ll start again in verse 17, the verses we read last week, and read through verse 24:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;<a href="">Eph 4:17-24 KJV</a> 17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, 18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: 19 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. 20 But ye have not so learned Christ; 21 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: 22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; 23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; 24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>So how are we sanctified? How do we stop sinning and start living like Jesus?</p>
<p>There are three really simple steps we can get from these verses. They are simple but they are essential. They are simple but that doesn&rsquo;t </p>
<p>make them always easy.</p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s pray and then I&rsquo;ll give them to you.</strong></p>
<p>The first step to being sactified after salvation is&hellip; </p><br />
<h2 class="">1. Understand the change salvation makes.</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely essential that we get this one point before we go any further - when God saved you, He didn&rsquo;t just reform you, He transformed you. He made you from one thing into another. A total, complete transformation from the inside out.</p>
<p>These verses we just read they allude to that all the way through. You are not any longer like those other gentiles. They are one thing and you are another. They are lost and you have been found. They are the devils and you are God&rsquo;s. They are darkness, you are light. </p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:17 says</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;<a href="">2Co 5:17 KJV</a> 17 Therefore if any man <a href="">be</a> in Christ, <a href="">he is</a> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>When you believed on Christ - you became a new creature. Totally new.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Jesus was teaching in the Sermon on the Mount. We are the salt of the earth, we are the light of the world. We aren&rsquo;t just cleaned up earth or cleaned up world - we are a totally and fundamentally different substance. We have a totally different nature.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been born again.</p>
<p>Now, this passage in Ephesians, it goes into a lot of detail about the Old man. Who we were before Christ and what those who have not yet believed on Christ are like.</p>
<p>Basically, it tells us that they are ignorant. That they have darkened hearts and minds. That they have refused God and because of that, their whole nature is tainted.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we looked at last week.</p>
<p>But verse 22 actually tells us a couple other things about this old man. </p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>It tells us that it is currupt. That&rsquo;s a word that means destroyed. There is something fundamentally broken about it. It&rsquo;s been defaced and broken.</p>
<p>And the way it&rsquo;s been defaced and broken is by &ldquo;the deceitful lusts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, I want to stop for a second and talk about the word &ldquo;lust&rdquo;. Everytime we hear the word &ldquo;lust&rdquo; we automatically think &ldquo;sex.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve come to equate lusts with sexual desires. That&rsquo;s really unfortunate, because lust doesn&rsquo;t always mean sexual desires - sometimes it does - but the word is much broader than that.</p>
<p>The word <strong>lust</strong>, just means <strong>urge</strong>. It can be an urge for sexual satisfaction, but it can also be an urge to have something, and urge to do something, an urge to be recognized, an urge to be powerful.</p>
<p>All of us have these urges. Those urges come from our old nature. From the old man. And those urges, when they aren&rsquo;t subjected to God&rsquo;s will - destroy us. They currupt us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the old man. But verse 24 also talks about the new man. This is what God makes us when we get saved.</p>
<p>It says</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.&rdquo;</em> </p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>The new man is godly. He is &ldquo;after God.&rdquo; The new man is &ldquo;righteous.&rdquo; The new man is &ldquo;holy.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Listen church, when you got saved, when you believed on Jesus - God did something inside of you and made you fundamentally righteous, fundamentaly holy, fundamentally godly. You now have the power to be a righteous, holy, godly person. That change has already been made. That swap has already happened.</p>
<p>So the first step to sanctification is realizing that. It&rsquo;s reallizing who you were before salvation and who you are now. You are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>The second step to sanctification is&hellip;</p><br />
<h2 class="">2. Exchange the old man for the new.</h2>
<p>Verse 22 says </p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Put off the old man.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>Verse 24 says</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Put on the new man.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>God here compares sanctification as changing your clothes. A couple of weeks ago, me and brother Harold were working on some of the plumbing downstairs. I wasn&rsquo;t anticipating getting dirty. I was just trying to move stuff out of the way.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m standing there, fiddling with some tools when all of a sudden I hear this loud &ldquo;crack&rdquo; and I feel this warm substance running down my neck. My clothes got currupted.</p>
<p><br>But, I didn&rsquo;t think it was that bad. And I knew I&rsquo;d be doing more work, so I just went on. A little later, we had to run to Home Depot to get some more parts, and after we&rsquo;d been in Home Depot for a little while, Brother Harold says to me &ldquo;Pastor, when we get back you should probably change your clothes. You kind of stink.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>Oh. I do. Thanks for telling me now.</p>
<p><br>So I went home and promptly took a shower. But I still had my old clothes. I like my old clothes. It was actually one of my favorite shirts. </p>
<p>How crazy would it be for me to put that stinky shirt back on after I&rsquo;ve had a shower?</p>
<p><br>That&rsquo;s the picture here. Before we were saved we were wearing the currupted clothes of our old lifestyle. When we trusted Christ, we got a spiritual shower and a new set of clothes. But we still have those old clothes. Unfortunately, many Christians put them back on.</p>
<p><br>Another example would be this. After the Civil War, there were thousands of people who were slaves and suddenly, by edict, they were now free. They had been emancipated. They were free men. Their station had fundamentally changed.</p>
<p><br>But all they had ever known was slavery. So history tells us that many of them went on acting just like nothing had changed. They acted like slaves. Stayed on in the same farms, serving the same master with the same attitude.</p>
<p><br>If you want to be sanctified - you&rsquo;ve got to change your clothes. God has given you a bath, God has given you a new nature, and God holds out for you a new lifestyle that isn&rsquo;t currupted. You&rsquo;ve got to throw those old clothes away and put on, once and for all, the new clothes God has given you.</p>
<p><strong><br>You have to realize what you were and what you are, and you have to make the conscious decision to live like a Christian.</strong> God has made you with a godly nature - live Godly. God has made you righteous - live righteous. God has made you holy. Live holy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really that simple. </p>
<p>Look, sometimes preachers complicate this. They talk about &ldquo;praying for victory.&rdquo; They talk about God helping you over some sin. They talk about letting go and letting God.</p>
<p><br>Can I tell you something - you won&rsquo;t find that in the scripture. None of it.</p>
<p><br>What you find is this - just figure out how God wants you to live, think about what is wrong with the old man&rsquo;s way, think about the new mans way and do it.</p>
<p><br>Just do it.</p>
<p><br>You don&rsquo;t need some emotional high. You don&rsquo;t need some altar experience. You got all of that you ever needed when you accepted Christ and the Holy Spirit took up residence in your life.</p>
<p>You just need to put off the old man and put on the new.</p>
<p>Put off the old, put on the new. Just do it.</p><br />
<hr>
<p><br>Now, at this point, you&rsquo;re probably thinking - Pastor Hayden, that sounds too simple. Or you might be thinking - Pastor Hayden, Does that mean I can immediately be sanctified for the rest of my life?</p>
<p>I mean it just sounds too easy. Experience tells us it&rsquo;s not as easy as that. Right?</p>
<p><br>Well, that&rsquo;s where the third part comes in. </p>
<p><br>You&rsquo;ve got to realize the change that was made in salvation. That&rsquo;s step one. You&rsquo;ve got to exchange the old way of living for the new way. That&rsquo;s step two.</p>
<p><br>The third step is&hellip; </p><br />
<h2 class="">3. Transform your mind.</h2>
<p><br>Look at verse 23. I&rsquo;ve purposely skipped over verse 23:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>Putting off the old man and putting on the new man - those are both a mental step you shouldn&rsquo;t have to make very often. They are a decision. I&rsquo;m different now, I should live different. Simple as that.</p>
<p>Being renewed in the spirit of your mind - that&rsquo;s a part of this process that is ongoing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like Romans 12. That says</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;<a href="">Rom 12:1-2 KJV</a> 1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, <a href="">which is</a> your reasonable service. 2 And be not conformed to this world:&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>All of that sounds like put off the old man, put on the new man. </p>
<p>But it goes on to say</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what <a href="">is</a> that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>So there we have it again - renewing the mind.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to renew your mind? This is important. This is how we accomplish our sactification. So follow along with me.</p>
<p>Remember how the verse says the old man is <em>&ldquo;currupt according to the deceitful lusts.&rdquo;</em> <strong>The old man has a mind problem.</strong> It&rsquo;s <strong>deceived</strong>. It&rsquo;s always being deceived by <em>&ldquo;deceitful lusts.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>If you go back to the verses we looked at last week, you can see this even clearer - the main problem with the &ldquo;other gentiles&rdquo; is that they <em>&ldquo;walk in the vanity of their mind.&rdquo;</em> <em>&ldquo;They have their understanding darkened.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>All of these problems, they all go back to the mind. To the mind.</p>
<p>Now, we as Christians are told to <em>&ldquo;renew our minds.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think that means: As human beings - we have mind problems and we have lust problems. You cannot trust your mind. As we live in this wicked world - we are all influenced more than we care to think by the world around us.</p>
<p>So we have to constantly have our minds corrected and brought into check with the mind of God. Of course, we do this through the Word of God.</p>
<p>Most of us men have had some time when we had to cut a lot of boards to the same size. So you measure once with your tape measure and begin cutting right? You use the first cut board as a template - but over time, if you aren&rsquo;t careful, the size of the cuts will start to vary from the original and you&rsquo;ll have to take the tape measure out and start all over.</p>
<p>Another example - maybe there is a recipe you like to cook that is specific. Like my pizza dough recipe. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve made that recipe. Has to be well over fifty - maybe hundreds. But sometimes I can get too cocky and think I have the recipe memorized more than I do - and it doesn&rsquo;t turn out right - so I have to return to the standard and pull out that recipe card.</p>
<p>So it is with our mind, we need to constantly be going back to the word of God to be renewed, to have a course correction, to check ourselves by the word of God.</p>
<p>So how are we sanctified? It&rsquo;s not some hocus-pocus, mystical, supernatural, sentimental thing. That already happened to us in salvation. No. We are sanctified as we 1)Realize who we were. 2) Embrace who we are. 3) Find out what God wants and 4) do it.</p>
<p>Now, over the next several weeks, we are going to look at some really concrete things that God expects from us. I mean, you can just look at the next verse in Ephesians to see that. May we put off the old man, renew our mind, and put on the new man as we study this passage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stand for invitation and prayer.</p><br></p>
