<p>This has been a super encouraging week for me. On Monday and Tuesday, I attended the <a href="http://www.sermonaudio.com/source_detail.asp?sourceid=faithbaptistavon">Outreach Conference at Faith Baptist Church in Avon, IN</a>. Some of the things I write about, namely the importance of biblical preaching, the wrongness of man worship, and the stupidity of manipulative ministry were all recurring themes in the preaching and workshops. I half expected these themes to be rejected by the large crowd of pastors who were there, but far from it, they seemed to be in enthusiastic agreement.</p>
<p>Then Wednesday, Jeff Amsbaugh, pastor of the Greater Rhode Island Baptist Temple and sometimes writer in the Sword of the Lord (in other words: someone other than a thirty year old pastor from the middle of nowhere) wrote the great article <a href="http://www.jeffamsbaugh.com/2014/03/11/keeping-young-fundamentalists-in-the-camp/">Keeping Young Fundamentalists in the Camp</a> &nbsp;where he said that it's time to take a stand against independent Baptist preachers who abuse the Bible and have unbiblical ministry philosophies. The article met with an awesome display of support on the internet.</p>
<p>It's been a really good week to be an independent Baptist.</p>
<p>Despite the overwhelming support and to no ones surprise, Pastor Amsbaugh's article did not receive universal acceptance among independent Baptist pastors. Those critical of the article seemed to be saying that to them, the article made excuses for young people who had "fallen away." Several people either posted verses or scripture references about some falling away. It seemed like the critics were saying "How dare you make excuses for those dirty little liberal reprobates?" or something similar.</p>
<p>I want to address the notion that all who leave the independent Baptist movement are "falling away" from the faith and have thus become the deserving objects of our scorn.</p>
<h2>Have they really fallen away?</h2><br />
I'm a thirty year old independent Baptist pastor. Many of the guys I went to Bible college with have left the independent Baptist movement. For me, <em><strong>there is something conspicuous about the guys who have left the independent Baptist movement</strong></em>: Almost to the man they were serious and spiritual students who kept their heads down. They were not the rebels. They were guys who were zealous about being serious Christians, committed to the bus ministry and preaching, and hard workers in their classes. There were rebels and libertines who I went to school with - most of them have either repented or are out of church completely. The guys I'm talking about were a totally different crowd.</p>
<p>Almost all of them have moved to &nbsp;independent Bible churches and a few have moved, with reservations, into the conservative Presbyterian churches. While I disagree with the stands they have taken, I would have a very hard time saying that they are no longer serious Christians, are no longer committed to evangelism, and no longer love the Bible and the church. They are not rushing out to get tattoos and drink beer. They are not trying to be hip Christians. To the contrary, each of the guys I'm thinking about are probably more zealous about Christianity than many independent Baptist pastors I know. (I recognize you may be operating from a different context.)</p>
<p>So have they fallen away from the faith?</p>
<p>Only if in your mind "the faith" equals "the independent Baptist movement." In which case, I'm afraid you're in for a surprise when you get to heaven some day. I believe being an independent Baptists is the most biblical position - but that hardly means that all non-independent Baptists are a part of the faith. Did A.W. Tozer fall away from the faith? &nbsp;Charles Spurgeon? &nbsp;D.L. Moody? &nbsp;Billy Sunday? &nbsp;None of these men were independent baptists.</p>
<p>But even if everyone who left an independent baptist church had fallen away...</p>
<h2>Are they &nbsp;worthy of our derision?</h2><br />
When I read the criticisms yesterday, it seemed like people were saying "How dare you lessen the heat on those young people who have fallen away?" "They've fallen away because they didn't have enough character."</p>
<p>In other words, the correct response to this is not introspection, but vocal rejection. We don't need to examine ourselves, (there's nothing wrong with us) we need to ramp up the criticism of those who would jump out of the frying pan and into the fire. They did it because they weren't strong enough, they did it because they lacked spiritual depth.</p>
<p>In other words they did it because they weren't as good as I am. I'm still an independent Baptist because I'm made of better stuff than they are.</p>
<p>Can they not see the inherent <strong>PRIDE</strong> in that reasoning? The self-righteousness?</p>
<p>Let's take a step back - what was Dr. Amsbaugh saying? I think he was just saying that part of the reason that young people are leaving the independent Baptist movement is because the independent Baptist movement has put some stumbling blocks in the way for young people.</p>
<p>Do you think it's godly (or charitable) to put down a stumbling block and then mock and berate the people who trip over it? Isn't the godly thing to do everything in our power to remove every stumbling block in the way?</p>
<p>Do some people leave independent Baptist churches and become something else because they want to live looser, or because they want the acceptance of the elite? Absolutely. &nbsp;<strong>But in my experience, just as many leave independent Baptist churches because those churches long ago stopped preaching the Bible, or because they grew sickened by the lifting up of men instead of the lifting up of Jesus, or because were over manipulative ministry.</strong> They went down the road to a group that didn't do those things, but had other problems.</p>
<p>The damage is done. It's too late for those who have already left.</p>
<p><strong>So what do we do?</strong></p>
<p>We've got to think about the young people who haven't left yet. Believe me, they are in your church and they may be the people you least expect.</p>
<p><em>The only way to stop young people from leaving for a looser church or for the world's acceptance is to compromise</em>. To stop preaching holiness. No independent Baptist pastor I know of is calling for that.</p>
<p><em>But there are things we can do to stop the other group from leaving.</em> We can go back to preaching the Bible, to humility and accountability in pastoral leadership, and to ministry that is, well, ministry and we can make enough noise about these issues that the independent Baptist movement becomes seriously uncomfortable for those who refuse to get it.</p>
<p>That will clot the hole that many young independent Baptists are bleeding out of. The really good news is that this is already happening.</p>
<p>What we can't do is plug our ears, minimize our own faults, put party before principle and mock our victims.</p>
