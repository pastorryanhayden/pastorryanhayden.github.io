<p>For many years, when I thought of John Phillips, I thought of a style of preaching and writing that was obsessed with alliteration. Now, I'm not against alliteration, I just feel that it gets in the way as much as it helps, and it has become almost mandatory in some circles preaching. So, I've avoided John Phillips commentaries like I avoid guacamole. If avocados (or alliteration) are your thing - have at it, but I'm going to stay away.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/9780825434952.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1212" alt="9780825434952" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/9780825434952-197x300.jpg" width="197" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>After, receiving a reviewer copy of John Phillips <a href="http://store.kregel.com/productdetails.cfm?PC=587">commentary on 1 Corinthians</a>, I'm changing my tune about his commentaries (if not alliteration.). 1 Corinthians is a pretty difficult book to preach through because it handles some awkward and difficult topics (sexuality, tongues, etc.) and because much of it is very context dependent. A good commentary is a huge help.</p>
<p>The realization I've come to is that Phillip&rsquo;s commentary is a good commentary. Once you push back the gag reflex at all of the alliteration, there is actually some really good content in there. He even writes from a conservative Baptist viewpoint, and bases his text on the KJV, which is not something you can say of most commentary authors. I&rsquo;ve especially liked his treatment of 1 Cor. 7 (careful and discreet without being prudish.).</p>
<p>So along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/First-Epistle-Corinthians-Anthony-Thiselton/dp/0802870910/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371522530&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=anthony+thiselton">Anthony Thiselton</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Corinthians-MacArthur-Testament-Commentary-Macarthur/dp/0802407544/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371522562&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=john+macarthur+1+corinthians">John MacArthur</a>, I&rsquo;ll be referencing Phillips for the remainder of my time in 1 Corinthians. Who knows, maybe when I pick another book, I'll have gotten used to the alliteration enough to pick up his commentary on that as well.</p>
