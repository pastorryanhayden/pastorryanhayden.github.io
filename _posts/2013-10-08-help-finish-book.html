<p>Over a year ago, I started working on a book that I plan to entitle <strong>We've Got Issues, But I Wouldn't Want To Be Anybody Else</strong>. My intention for the book was that it be a look at places where independent Baptists (and I'm talking from experience about the Hyles/Sword of the Lord strain of independent Baptists) have gone wrong and then why I still choose to be one.</p>
<p>To say the book has stalled would be an understatement. Writing a book worth reading is hard work. I'm still planning of finishing it, but I thought that posting what I had would maybe help stir ideas. &nbsp;At the very least, it might motivate me to finish. In other words, I'm looking for your help finishing my book.</p>
<p>So this week I want to post the chapters that I've written so far. My outline for the Issues section of the book is:</p>
<ul>
<li>We've thrown out biblical preaching.</li>
<li>We've kicked intellectuals to the curb.</li>
<li>We worship successful leaders.</li>
<li>We've become partisans.</li>
<li>We've become everythingists.</li>
<li>We're trying to bring back the 1960's.</li><br />
</ul><br />
So far, I have the introduction and the first three of those chapters written. I'm going to release a chapter every day this week. Please let me know what you think. Below is the introduction:</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Do you remember the first time you took your girlfriend/fianc&eacute; to a family reunion?&nbsp; If your family was anything like mine, then you had a few conversations during the van ride over. You said things like this:&nbsp; "Now Uncle Frank is really into Lord of the Rings and magic", "Whatever you do, don't ask Cousin Lucile what her husband does for a living. (He won't work.)", "Uncle John really likes to hear himself talk," and "Don't say anything about guns around Aunt Jane (she'll go off)."&nbsp; Despite all of that, you probably tried to emphasize that yes, your family has issues, but despite that, they're pretty great.&nbsp; When you went to visit her family, hopefully, you came away with the same impression.</p>
<p>Every family has its issues.&nbsp; You grow up around them, you don't talk about them often, but you realize they are there.&nbsp; Sometimes, it takes an outsiders eye to bring them to light.</p>
<p>I grew up in the Independent Fundamental Baptist family.&nbsp; From the time I was 6, my family was in an Independent Baptist Church.&nbsp; We attended churches in Leesburg, VA, in Chelmsford, MA, and in Londonderry, NH.&nbsp; As a teenager, I felt God's call on my life and went to Bible college at Crown College, an Independent Baptist college in Knoxville, TN.&nbsp; I was then privileged to work for two Independent Baptist churches, one in New Hampshire and another in Tennessee, before being called to Pastor an Independent Baptist Church in Mattoon, Illinois.&nbsp; As long as I can remember, I've been a part of the Independent Fundamental Baptist family.</p>
<p>Through my ministry experience, as well as through attending special meetings, going on missions trips, having special speakers in my church, and going to conferences, I think I've had a glimpse of almost every corner of the IFB family.&nbsp; I've been under pastors who went to college at Bob Jones and pastors who went to college at Hyles Anderson and everything in between.&nbsp; I've had the privilege of fellowshipping over a meal with "successful" pastors from all around the country.&nbsp; Overall, my impressions are favorable.&nbsp; I can't think of a family I would rather be a part of.</p>
<p>But we definitely have issues.&nbsp; Unlike a family, no one ever seems to talk about them or want to admit them.&nbsp; Most fundamentalists seem to be in a state of denial.</p>
<p>When you present something as flawless, as above criticism, when in fact it isn't, then you are setting people up for disillusionment.</p>
<p>Too many young preachers like myself are getting out of the van of training, getting into the family reunion of ministry in IFB churches, and running for their lives. There is a huge difference between what they see and what was described to them and no one around them wants to admit it.</p>
<p>That's why I want to write this book.&nbsp; It may seem harsh.&nbsp; I'm sure it's going to decrease my popularity with a lot of people, but to keep people in the family, we have to admit some of its issues.</p>
<p>This book has two major parts.&nbsp; The first part lists what I see are the six major issues of the Independent Fundamental Baptist movement that we&rsquo;ve never dealt with.&nbsp; For each issue, I will examine the Biblical ideal, state how our churches fall short of it, trace this problem through our history, and list some possible ways to make it right.</p>
<p>I will strive to deal with ideas, not with people, but at times it will be necessary to name people in specific examples.&nbsp; I mean them no disrespect, just like my family members they are loved, respected, and valuable members of the family, but they're still human and all humans are flawed.&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, whenever possible I will provide the research behind my assertions in the footnotes.&nbsp; If no notes exist, its safe to assume my assumptions are based on personal experience or anecdotal evidence.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t apologize for that, it is the nature of this book.</p>
<p>In the second part of the book, I will list the reasons why I think our movement is worth staying in.&nbsp; After looking at our families issues, we'll gain some perspective by looking at those of other families (they have issues too, and many of the same ones). Hopefully, you'll conclude like I have that, though our movement is far from perfect, it's the best place to be.</p>
