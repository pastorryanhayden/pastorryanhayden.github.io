<p>This week I&rsquo;m writing about &ldquo;Things IFB pastors could learn from the Calvinists.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not a calvinist. Been there, done that, bought the T-shirt. While I don&rsquo;t think hard core calvinism is Biblical or healthy, I think that calvinists have a lot to teach us.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a lot of the young guys who are going &ldquo;calvi&rdquo; probably wouldn&rsquo;t if we&rsquo;d learn these things:</p>

<h1 id="nofearofdoctrineortheintellect.">2. No fear of doctrine or the intellect.</h1><br />
Growing up, when I thought of calvinist, I conjured in my mind a bunch of over-read egg heads debating the tenets of infralapsarianism in churches with no more than twenty people in them. Now, when I think of Calvinists, some of the first people that come to mind are Mark Driscoll and David Platt. A lot has changed in twenty years.</p>
<p>Independent Baptists have a strong strain of anti-intellectualism running through their ranks. In some ways, that&rsquo;s a good thing. There is a danger of being pompously intellectual or whittling down Christianity into nothing more than a neat theological system. But we&rsquo;ve gone farther than just a healthy fear of over-intellect, we&rsquo;ve become wary of almost anybody who is intellectual.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/doctrine.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-941" alt="doctrine" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/03/doctrine-1024x583.jpg" width="628" height="357" /></a></p>
<p>The problem with that is that it&rsquo;s obvious that God uses intellectuals. The writings of Paul aren&rsquo;t difficult because you read a KJV (they&rsquo;re tricky in the Greek), the writings of Paul are difficult because you have to <strong>think</strong> to understand them. Even Peter, the fisherman, writes and preaches using a vocabulary that&rsquo;s outside of the wheelhouse of many independent Baptists. God uses Elijahs, we&rsquo;re grateful for that, but he also uses Daniels and Isaiahs too.</p>
<p>Scripture is clear that one of the things the church needs is &ldquo;doctrine.&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/2Timothy3%3A16" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) We can learn from the model of Paul&rsquo;s letters that application follows doctrine. Yet for many years, we&rsquo;ve been either so caught up in pragmatism or scared of doctrinal debate that many of us have no idea what we believe.</p>
<p>One thing you can say about calvinists is that they&rsquo;ve never been afraid of doctrine. They revel in it. One of the great appeals of calvinists to young preachers is that, not only do they know and teach doctrine, but they have a seemingly endless tradition of doctrinal teachers from which to draw. (Calvin, Owen, Martyn Lloyd Jones, Etc.)</p>
<p>I know a lot of independent Baptists, even independent Baptist christians, who have almost no clue what justification, propitiation, or sanctification are. Who have no real doctrine of the Holy Spirit. Who have a very shallow view of sin. We have to get over this. We have to realize that we must &ldquo;study to give an answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you dropped John Bunyan or Charles Spurgeon or Charles Wesley or G. Campbell Morgan or Harry Ironside into the middle of your church service, would they even recognize your version of Christian <strong>doctrine</strong>? We&rsquo;ve got to be more than a few millimeters deep (the Bible is) if we have any hope of keeping a generation from following hard into the calvinist tidal wave. They&rsquo;ve got doctrine, do we?</p>
