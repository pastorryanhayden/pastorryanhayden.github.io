<p>This week I&rsquo;ve been writing out the positions that I hold, that will keep me from ever being accepted in mainstream evangelicalism. I&rsquo;m not writing &nbsp;to attack mainstream evangelicals, so much as to state clearly the things I believe that are an issue to most evangelicals. &nbsp; So far, I&rsquo;ve written:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Reasons I Could Never Be Mainstream" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/reasons-i-could-never-be-mainline/">Introduction</a></li>
<li><a title="Reasons I Could Never Be Mainstream: Separation" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/reasons-i-could-never-be-mainline-separation/">Separation</a></li>

</ul><br />

<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to write about a fourth reason:</p>
<h2 id="iuseonlythekingjamesversionofthebible.">I use only the King James Version of the Bible.</h2></p>
<h3 id="talkingaboutthisissueisaquickwaytogetmarginalized.">Talking about this issue is a quick way to get marginalized.</h3><br />
If there was a single issue, besides separation, that distinguishes independent Baptists from other groups it is the King James Bible.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bibles.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-897" alt="bibles" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/03/bibles-300x207.png" width="300" height="207" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In many &ldquo;circles&rdquo; saying you are King James only is like walking onto the campus of Harvard and asking where the local Klu Klux Klan meets. It&rsquo;s a really fast way to marginalize yourself as either a hardened zealot or a ignorant bumpkin.</p>
<p>Conversely, in parts of fundamentalism, if you don&rsquo;t take a &ldquo;strong enough stand&rdquo; on the King James Bible then you might as well be having seances and child sacrifices in your church basement. You are an instant heretic.</p>
<h3 id="thewrongwaytodefendthekingjames.">The wrong way to defend the King James.</h3><br />
When evangelicals criticize King-James-Only people, they have a lot of ammunition.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;There are quite a few really poor or downright dishonest books written in favor of King-James-Onlyism. (I&rsquo;m sorry, but Gail Riplinger and Bill Grady are not credible sources.)</li>
<li>There are also a lot of people who rush to the defense of the King James and know almost nothing about what they are talking about. I&rsquo;ve heard preachers preach an entire sermon on the King James from the text <em>&ldquo;Forever, O Lord, Thy word is settled in heaven.&rdquo;</em> as if those words are an unshakeable argument. (Couldn&rsquo;t you preach the same sermon from a Tyndale, Bishops, or Geneva Bible against the KJV because they all predate it.)</li>
<li>There are those who thump on a King James Bible and shout 1611 like its a cheer at a basketball game when the Bible they are using is actually a 1769.</li>
<li>Worst of all are those who take the ridiculous position that the King James Version corrects the Greek text and is somehow &ldquo;double inspired.&rdquo;</li><br />
</ul><br />
When you read books written on the textual issue that are critical of King James people, they almost always focus on these groups, because they are easy targets.</p>
<h3 id="mykingjamesposition-thereceivedtextposition">My King James Position - The Received Text Position</h3><br />
But I&rsquo;m not King James only for any of those reasons. This is why I use the King James:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you believe the new versions are best, you have to believe that for 1600+ years Christians operated with an inferior and incomplete Bible, and that God used a few devoted theological liberals to find the missing parts in places like the vatican dump.</blockquote><br />
In other words, I&rsquo;m not a King James person so much as I am a <strong>Textus Receptus </strong>or<strong> Recieved Text</strong> person. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, the Textus Receptus was the Greek text used to by everyone until the 1870&rsquo;s when Westcott and Hort found some supposedly &ldquo;older&rdquo; manuscripts from which come all of the new Bible translations. I don&rsquo;t buy it. I think it goes against God&rsquo;s promise to preserve His word.</p>
<p>Right now there are only two texts in common use that were translated out of the TR. The King James and the New King James. The New King James is inferior in its use of language, and several on its translating committee were openly hostile to the received text (TR) position.</p>
<p>Nobody is arguing that the King James is an inferior translation. Several months ago I chuckled as I listened to a podcast where Albert Mohler and Leland Ryken (neither of whom are King James only men) talked for forty minutes about how accurate, beautiful and enduring the King James Bible is, only to spend the last few minutes awkwardly explaining why they don&rsquo;t use it. There is a reason why the KJV rings in our ears, it has become the gold standard.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not trying to put down those who don&rsquo;t use the KJV. Actually, it hasn&rsquo;t been my intention with any of these posts to put down those who don&rsquo;t hold to my positions. I can still learn from them in an many cases fellowship with them. &nbsp;I read plenty of books written by non-kjvo guys. I just want to state what I believe that is different and state why and point out the obvious, that those who hold these views are usually&nbsp;<em>persona non grata</em> outside of fundametnalism.</p>
