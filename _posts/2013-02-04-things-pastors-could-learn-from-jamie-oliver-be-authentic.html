<p>This is the second post in my series of things &ldquo;Pastors could learn from Jamie Oliver.&rdquo; If you don&rsquo;t know who Jamie Oliver is, I recommend you read my <a title="Five Things Pastors Can Learn From Jamie Oliver: Introduction." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/five-things-pastors-can-learn-from-jamie-oliver-introduction/">introduction</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing I think pastors could learn from Jamie Oliver is to</p>
<h1 id="beauthentic.">Be Authentic.</h1><br />
I am nothing like Jamie Oliver. I am sitting now in my office, wearing dress clothes and a cardigan (like I do almost every day) having just finished reading a series of commentaries in preparation for preaching on the tabernacle on Wednesday. Most of the time, I dress like a model from an L.L. Bean or Lands End catalogue (I&rsquo;m not saying I look like one). People comment regularly on the similarity between myself and the dad from the Denice the Menace comics. To sum it up, I&rsquo;m a conservative, geeky square. No one ever has or ever will mistake me for a hipster.</p>
<p>Jamie Oliver has outrageous spiky hair. Dresses in a very grungy fashion. Wears old Chuck Taylor sneakers almost exclusively and laces his speech with the word &ldquo;brother&rdquo; (think rock star, not southern baptist.) To sum it up, no one would mistake Jamie Oliver for anything but a hipster. Despite this, people who are nothing like Jamie Oliver (like myself) are drawn to him because Jamie Oliver is himself. He is ridiculously comfortable in his own skin. He never looks like he is trying to be someone else.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/authentic.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-566" alt="authentic" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/authentic.jpg" width="400" height="194" /></a></p>
<p>When you watch cooking shows, the kitchen sets the actors work in are almost uniformly beautiful, modern clean places filled to the brim with new looking cooking gadgets. In contrast, Jamie Oliver usually films in old looking kitchens filled with grungy and homely looking utensils.</p>
<p>Jamie Oliver was literally raised in a pub (His parents ran a bar.) He spent his youth and early adulthood fronting a Rock Band. So Jamie Oliver when Jamie Oliver acts like a grungy hippy former rock star, he isn&rsquo;t acting, that&rsquo;s who he is.</p>
<p>So how does this apply to pastors?</p>
<p>If you think my point is that we should all emulate Jamie Oliver you are dead wrong. My point isn&rsquo;t that pastors should act like hipsters. Actually, I think <em>one of the banes of modern ministry is pastors who are acting like hipsters</em>. The last thing we need is more young preachers trying desperately to be cool. My point is that pastors should be themselves.</p>
<p>People crave authenticity.</p>
<p>When we are around someone who isn&rsquo;t putting on airs and who is comfortable in their own skin, we are usually drawn to that person. Unfortunately, a lot of pastors are trying to be anything but themselves. They pick some successful preacher and think by emulating him they can have his success.</p>
<p>Let me give you my thoughts on this and you can take it or leave it. <em>(<strong>Warning:&nbsp;</strong>At this point this post is going to devolve into a rant about copycat&rsquo;s in fundamentalism.)</em></p>
<h2 id="stoptryingtopreachlikesomeoneelse.">Stop trying to preach like someone else.</h2><br />
I went to Crown College which means I&rsquo;ve heard Clarence Sexton preach about a thousand times. I&rsquo;m grateful for Dr. Sexton, I&rsquo;m grateful for his ministry and for his emphasis on scripture. I&rsquo;m not grateful, however, for Clarence Sexton clones.</p>
<p>Just because I went to Crown doesn&rsquo;t mean I have to lean on the front of my pulpit or hobble around (Dr. Sexton had back surgery) or say &ldquo;if you are in the habit of marking things in your Bible&rdquo; or &ldquo;gospel records&rdquo; or &ldquo;turn with me in the New Testament to the Hebrew Christian Church Epistles to the book of the Revelation of Jesus given by Saint John&rdquo; or any of the other rhetorical or semantic eccentricities Dr. Sexton is so famous for. I&rsquo;m not Clarence Sexton, I&rsquo;m Ryan Hayden.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from New Hampshire. It&rsquo;s the ground zero of Yankeedom. I&rsquo;ve seen preachers grow up in New Hampshire, go off to train somewhere in the South or Midwest, and come back to New England preaching with a southern accent. Huh??&nbsp;(I love the south and married a southern girl, but making southernness as big a part of fundamental Christianity as it is is a particular pet peeve of mine and will probably someday be it&rsquo;s own blog series.)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been influenced by someone, praise God for it, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to preach like them for the rest of our life. God didn&rsquo;t make you a bad clone of your favorite preacher, he made you you. Embrace that and move on.</p>
<h2 id="stopdressinglikesomeoneelse.">Stop dressing like someone else.</h2><br />
One of the weird things about independent fundamental Baptists is how our churches become incubators for odd church fashions. When was the last time you saw anybody but a independent fundamental Baptist (or African American preacher, or Craig Sager) wear any of the following: curved collar shirts, flowery pocket squares, multicolored patent leather shoes, off-colored blazers, chunky plastic glasses, double breasted suits or ornamental abstract ties. I hate the web sites that are set up to poke fun at Independent Baptists, but when it comes to certain parts of Independent Baptist subculture, I&rsquo;m tempted to join in.</p>
<p>Stop it. Stop it now.</p>
<p>Dressing like Clarence Sexton, Jack Hyles, John R. Rice, Curtis Hutson, Bob Jones III et. al. does not make you one ounce more holy or one slither more effective as a preacher. What it does is make regular people think you are weird.</p>
<p>I could go on and on about copying other parts of well established ministries (decor, web sites, literature, etc.), but I&rsquo;ve digressed.</p>
<p>The main point is we pastors need to remember that God made us each unique. We are different ages and carry that into our pulpits. We all come from different contexts and carry that as well. Instead of copying others, let just be the person God made us to be. If it doesn&rsquo;t look like someone else, so be it.</p>
