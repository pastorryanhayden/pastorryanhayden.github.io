<p>There is a style of preaching that I think is inherently<br />
dangerous and needs to stop. I'm talking about the kind of<br />
preaching that jumps from topic to topic, making fun and calling<br />
names. I'm talking about the kind of preaching that aims to be<br />
boldly controversial in a place where controversial isn't<br />
controversial at all. I'm talking about the fast talking,<br />
birdshot-shooting, ranting rip-face kind of preaching. I call it<br />
bully preaching. Before I go further, let me say in the interest of<br />
full disclosure, that I know this style of preaching was sometimes<br />
used by the heroes of fundamentalism past. I know it was sometimes used, for instance, in the preaching of Billy Sunday and Jack<br />
Hyles. I know there are evangelists who use this style as their<br />
bread and butter. Nevertheless, I still think it's dangerous: It's<br />
constant fodder for scorners, a stumbling block to the faithful, an<br />
ear tickling for the self-righteous and some cotton candy thrown<br />
out to the malnourished sheep. As a pastor, if I know someone is<br />
prone to bully preaching - I'll do everything I can to make sure<br />
they never stand behind the pulpit of Bible Baptist. When special<br />
speakers are invited, I try to make it plain in advance that this<br />
style of preaching will be neither appreciated nor tolerated. On<br />
top of the reasons above, let me give you four reasons why:</p>
<h3>1. Bully preaching is primarily entertainment<br />
preaching.</h3> The bully preacher may say "We need to warn<br />
the people." But two things need to be kept in mind: First, there<br />
probably aren't any homosexuals, abortionists, cross-dressers,<br />
theological liberals, etc. in the Sunday evening service at the<br />
local independent Baptist church. Second, even if they were a<br />
thirty second insulting soundbite isn't going to get them to change<br />
their ways. No matter what anyone says, the main purpose for bully<br />
preaching is to entertain a crowd. It's the preaching equivalent of<br />
the popular brat in the fifth grade lunch room doling out yo-mama<br />
jokes and making fun of the teacher's receding hairline. It's<br />
picking yourself up by putting others down. For a Christian saved<br />
by grace, that's the equivalent of a miraculously cured cancer<br />
patient going to the cancer ward at the local hospital to make fun<br />
of the bald heads and thin people. It's totally unacceptable.</p>
<h3>2. Bully preaching is rarely truthful<br />
preaching.</h3> Don't misunderstand this point. I'm not<br />
saying that the soundbites thrown out aren't "truthy", they have an<br />
element of truth, but they most often not<br />
<strong>completely</strong> truthful. How can I say<br />
this? I can say it because bullying relies on two things that are<br />
not coherent with complete truthfulness: exaggeration and<br />
generalization. If you remove those two elements from bully<br />
preaching, it stops being bully preaching.<br />
<h3>3. Bully<br />
preaching is almost never loving preaching.</h3> One of the<br />
many things <a<br />
href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians13"<br />
class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians<br />
13</a> teaches us about love is that charity<br />
<em>"rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the<br />
truth."</em> One of the things I think the scripture means by<br />
that is that a person who has true Christian love is a person that<br />
refuses to get any kind of satisfaction out of the wrongdoing of<br />
others. What is bully preaching if not gaining some type of<br />
satisfaction out of the wrongdoing of others? Even if this is not<br />
the case, it is certainly not what Paul meant when he said we<br />
should be <em>"speaking the truth in love."</em></p>
<h3>4. Bully preaching is always diversionary<br />
preaching.</h3> My biggest problem with bully preaching isn't<br />
anything listed above - it's that the bully preacher isn't doing<br />
what he should be doing: preaching and explaining the Word of God.<br />
Here's a quick homework assignment: <em>look through the New<br />
Testament and catalogue what percentage of the teaching and<br />
preaching there could ever pass as bully preaching.</em> I<br />
can think of two passages: Jesus' famous denunciation of the<br />
Pharisees and Paul's admonition about the Cretans in Titus.<br />
<strong>I don't think these passages are normative and I<br />
don't think they are adequate excuses for bully<br />
preachers.</strong> First, because they both Jesus and Paul<br />
were under inspiration we cannot claim and were therefore perfectly<br />
truthful. Second, because they make up such a small percentage of<br />
the recorded teaching and preaching of scripture. Third, because<br />
both of those instances were focused on a singular issue or group<br />
and balanced out by commands for Bible based teaching. People don't<br />
need a running commentary on what's wrong with the world, modern<br />
Christianity, the democratic party, and blue dress shirts - they<br />
need the scripture - read, explained and applied. It's bad enough<br />
when a traveling evangelist does this, but when a pastor does this<br />
week by week, it's a tragic setup for malnourishment. I think we<br />
should treat bully preachers the same way we treat bully fifth<br />
graders in the high school lunch room - remove their audience and<br />
let their fire die out from lack of air. Let them go back to their<br />
corner and deal with their own insecurity. Eventually they'll<br />
learn, like all bullies should, that bullying gets you nowhere<br />
worth going.</p>
