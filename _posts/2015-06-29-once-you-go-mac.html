<p><span class="token p">Recently, we at the Hayden household had a bit of a harsh reminder of why we use Mac's primarily:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="token p">I've not been a fan of Microsoft for some time, but under it's new leadership, it's made some pretty impressive moves that have thawed my dislike. I want to like Microsoft now. I was an early beta tester on Windows 10, and I"m really impressed by it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="token p">Then this happened: My wife got some birthday money and wanted some form of smartwatch/fitness tracker. Her mom and brother both have Microsoft Bands, so she got one.</span> <span class="token p">The Band was OK. The fit was never comfortable, but she liked it.</span></p>
<p><span class="token p"> Then, two weeks later, the screen started tweaking out and she had to send it in for repairs.</span> <span class="token p">So far, no problem. That could happen with any device. The problem is that Microsoft's customer service is a disjointed nightmare.</span></p>
<p><span class="token p"><span class="token strong"><em><strong>Weeks</strong></em></span>&nbsp;after sending the band in, she got a box from Microsoft in the mail. In the box was an obviously refurbished band - not her band - with absolutely no information. Amanda had to call customer service again just to figure out how to pair it, and she was disappointed that she got a refurbished band when she had purchased a new band just weeks ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="token p">At that point, she decided to call and request a refund. At the very least - she would go and buy a new, non-refurbished band. Getting a refund from Microsoft is slightly harder than getting milk from a rock. They said bring it back to Best Buy, but Amanda was told by customer service to return her band in the original packaging, and there was no way Best Buy was giving us a refund with a refurbished device and no packaging. It took hours - actually days, of phone tag to get Microsoft to authorize a refund. Then we had to ship the device back, at our expense, and were told that it would be a month before we had any money. </span></p>
<p><span class="token p">Over the last ten years I've had dozens of interactions with Apple's customer service. I've never once had anything less than an excellent experience. I've never once got the idea that the people I was talking to didn't know what was going on. I've never felt like information was lost between departments. Customer service is never fun, but Apple's customer service is actually customer service, and not some half-done afterthought.</span> <span class="token p">I live three hours from the nearest apple store, there have been times I've had to send my iPhone in for repair. Even with the mail, it never took more than a couple days to get my phone back.</span></p>
<p><span class="token p">Apple computers are expensive. I currently don't use a Mac laptop because I can't afford one. (In case you were wondering, I use a Toshiba Chromebook and my desktop computer is a Mac Mini.) I've contemplated buying a Microsoft Surface.<strong> It's not going to happen.</strong> Not a chance. </span> <span class="token p">I depend heavily on my computers to get work done and I'm willing to pay a premium to work with a company that has it's act together. As much as I want to like&nbsp;you Microsoft - you've got a long way to go.</span></p>
