<p>Recently, I noticed that Lancaster Baptist Church has a new web page. I don&rsquo;t know if this redesign happened this week or three months ago, all I know is that I like it - a lot. LBC has always been a leader in independent Baptist church ministry, and their website has always been fantastic - but I really feel like that with this design, they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;upped their game&rdquo; even more.</p>
<p>You can view the site at <a title="Lancaster Baptist Church" href="https://www.lancasterbaptist.org/" target="_blank">lancasterbaptist.org.</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em><em> I had nothing at all to do with the creation of the Lancaster Baptist Church web site. I&rsquo;m merely commenting on a job well done by others. </em></strong></p>
<p>Let me show you the five things that make this website better than 99% of church websites I&rsquo;ve seen:</p>
<h3>1. The site doesnt&rsquo; have a slider.</h3><br />
This site bucks a lot of church website conventions. Some conventions, like having your navigation at the top of the page, should never be messed with because doing so would&nbsp;do nothing but confuse people.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Lancaster_Baptist_Church___Pastor_Paul_Chappell.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1974" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Lancaster_Baptist_Church___Pastor_Paul_Chappell-300x221.jpg" alt="Lancaster_Baptist_Church___Pastor_Paul_Chappell" width="300" height="221" /></a></p>
<p>But other times, web designers get stuck in a rut and do things just because they do them. One of those &ldquo;rut&rdquo; trends is the web slider. You know, the photo underneath the logo of the website that stays for a second, only to be replaced by another one that &ldquo;slides&rdquo; in.</p>
<p>Why are they there? They don&rsquo;t serve much of a purpose, and they are the first thing on the site that looks stale. Yet EVERY church website has one. (Yes, even the church I pastor.)</p>
<p>Every church website besides LBC.</p>
<h3>2. The navigation area is used to solve common visitor problems.</h3><br />
The navigation (i.e. main menu) of almost every church website is the same: Home, About, Media, Gospel Presentation, Contact. The navigation on the LBC website doesn&rsquo;t follow that convention, instead it has buttons for: Discover, Connect, Ministries, Media, and Members. I think they are attempting to go from &ldquo;This is our information and it&rsquo;s organized logically&rdquo; to &ldquo;What are you here for? Let me get you what you need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[gallery ids="1975,1976"]</p>
<p>The navigation system on the new LBC website has some pretty neat tricks up it&rsquo;s sleeve. Here are some of the things I noticed that I thought were&nbsp;really cool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rather than having one, long vertical list, they opted for a wide navigation sorted with a clear hierarchy. It&rsquo;s much easier to find what you are looking for.</li>
<li>In each category, the navigation contains essential information or links you wouldn&rsquo;t normally see on a menu. For example, the &ldquo;discover&rdquo; tab has the service times <em>right in the menu</em> and the &ldquo;connect&rdquo; tab has contact info and social links <em>right in the menu</em>. I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone do this before and I really like it.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Media&rdquo; menu has a horizontal list of photographic buttons. It&rsquo;s pretty neat looking.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Members&rdquo; menu has sign up links for volunteers and you can watch the latest announcement video <em>right in the menu</em>.</li><br />
</ul><br />
I love the way this menu is executed. It&rsquo;s the best looking menu I&rsquo;ve seen yet on a church website.</p>
<h3>3. The homepage is remarkably simple.</h3><br />
I took the time to count the words (minus the main navigation and the footer) on the LBC homepage and the number came up very close to 200. (By way of comparison, the home page for my <em>personal</em> site has over 300 words.) &nbsp;For a church as large as LBC, getting your home page so simple that it has around 200 words is very impressive. It manages to do this without feeling sparse at all.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Lancaster_Baptist_Church___Pastor_Paul_Chappell-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1977" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Lancaster_Baptist_Church___Pastor_Paul_Chappell-4-300x221.jpg" alt="Lancaster_Baptist_Church___Pastor_Paul_Chappell 4" width="300" height="221" /></a></p>
<p>Why would they cut so much out of their home page? I&rsquo;m guessing they did it to make the things they did feature seem more important. In my opinion, mission accomplished.</p>
<h3>4. The site has no textures and tons of great photography.</h3><br />
Almost every church website employs background textures, but the Web Design industry moved away from textures a long time ago (or what seems like a long time ago in web design years.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Lancaster-Baptist-Church-Pastor-Paul-Chappell.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1978" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Lancaster-Baptist-Church-Pastor-Paul-Chappell-79x300.jpg" alt="Lancaster Baptist Church | Pastor Paul Chappell" width="79" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>In contrast to that, the Lancaster Baptist site has no textures. The only thing even close to a texture is the subtle gradient under the main navigation. It&rsquo;s what we in web design call a &ldquo;flat&rdquo; design.</p>
<p>But it manages to not seem flat at all. In fact, if I had to say describe the aesthetic of the site in a few words I&rsquo;d say &ldquo;it has depth.&rdquo; Through the use of great, full width photography and white space, the site manages to provide a sense of depth that doesn&rsquo;t feel artificial at all.</p>
<h3>5. They embraced &ldquo;Mobile First.&rdquo;</h3><br />
Go to lancasterbaptist.org now and resize your browser. It&rsquo;s very fluid and very responsive.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to that kind of responsiveness and fluidity by making a complex site and hacking off detail at smaller screen sizes. The only way to accomplish that is by designing for smaller screens first and then adding detail as the screen grows. LBC did a remarkable job of this.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3><br />
A lot of independent Baptist pastors shameless copy Lancaster Baptist. I&rsquo;m one of them. In almost every area, I think that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>If every IFB church shamelessly copied LBC&rsquo;s web design philosophy, I think it would be very good. Cudo&rsquo;s to the team at Lancaster for going in a totally different direction.</p>
<p><strong>If you&rsquo;d like me to work on your ministry or personal website, please contact me. I do one site every two weeks. Currently, I&rsquo;m booked through September.</strong></p>
