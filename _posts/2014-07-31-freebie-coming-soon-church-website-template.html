<p>Recently, a web design client asked me to put up a &ldquo;Coming Soon&rdquo; page for his church website while we work on their church website. This got me thinking about the ideal &ldquo;Coming Soon&rdquo; page for a church.</p>
<p>Ideally, a &ldquo;Coming Soon&rdquo; page would let people know that a new website is coming, while at the same time meeting as many of the needs of website visitors as possible. The majority of church website visitors are going to be looking for one of these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service Schedule</li>
<li>The church&rsquo;s location (with directions to the church.)</li>
<li>How to get in touch with the church.</li>
<li>Who the pastor is and how to get in touch with him.</li><br />
</ul><br />
With that in mind, I cranked out a simple coming soon page that provides the visitor with all of the essential info and is generic enough for me to use in future projects. It&rsquo;s got a lightweight, mobile-first, responsive design.</p>
<p>You can view the template below:</p>
<p>[gallery ids="1953,1954"]</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve decided to give it away.</strong></p>
<p>If you are a pastor who is setting up a church website, and want to be able to provide a simple &ldquo;Coming Soon&rdquo; page while you are going through that process. Feel free to download the zipped folder below, tweak it to your heart&rsquo;s desire and upload it to your church website.</p>
<p>[callout type="left, center, right" title="Download the Free Template" message="Click the link below to download the free Coming Soon template." button_text="Start Download" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47159282/comingsoon.zip" target="blank"]</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to do it:</p>
<h3>1. Download and unpack the zipped file.</h3></p>
<h3>2. Replace the images</h3><br />
You&rsquo;ll only need two things for this file. A logo file with a white background that is less than 115px tall and a picture of your pastor that is 135px square. You&rsquo;ll simply replace the images/logo.jpg with your own file named logo.jpg and the images/pastorthumb.jpg with your own pastorthumb.jgp file.</p>
<h3>3. Replace the information in the HTML file.</h3><br />
Open the index.html file in a text editor and make the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>On line 7, you&rsquo;ll want to change everything between the title tags.</li>
<li>On line 21 you&rsquo;ll want to put your church name between the h1 tags.</li>
<li>On lines 37-40, you&rsquo;ll want to change the service information if it does&rsquo;t match your church.</li>
<li>On line 49 you&rsquo;ll add a short description of where your church is at.</li>
<li>On line 50 you&rsquo;ll replace the address with your own.</li>
<li>On line 51 you&rsquo;ll replace your address in the google link (your address goes after the &ldquo;maps.google.com/?=&ldquo; part)</li>
<li>On line 60-80 replace the contact info with your info.</li>
<li>On line 92 replace the pastor intro paragraph with one of your own making.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<h3>4. Save the index.html file</h3></p>
<h3>5. Upload everything IN the unzipped file to the home directory of your website using FTP.</h3><br />
You should now have a nice &ldquo;Coming Soon&rdquo; page for your website.</p>
