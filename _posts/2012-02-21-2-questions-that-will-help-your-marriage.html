<blockquote><em>"Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God."</em></blockquote></p>
<p>In Ephesians 5:21, God gives us the best marriage advice possible: <strong>Be in a constant state of mutual submission.</strong></p></p>
<p>The thing about mutual submission is I can't know if I am going to receive, I have to give in faith. I can't control her, I can only control me (and me is all I'm responsible for). I've always had a hard time with this (After all, I am a human being and thus inherently selfish). Over the last couple months,&nbsp;I've been praying that the Lord would help me to be a better husband to my wonderful wife, Amanda.</p></p>

<p>Somewhere over the last couple months (I have no idea where, but I'm sure it's not original to me) I got the idea to be constantly asking my wife a two simple questions.</p></p>
<h3>1. Honey, is there anything I can do for you right now?</h3></p>
<p>I try to ask my wife this at least three times a day. At first she thought I was after something. More than once I heard <em>"What do you want?"</em> or <em>"What are you after?"</em> but the reason I was doing it was because it put me in the frame of mind to be a servant. Sometimes she answers with "you could do the dishes" and sometimes "you could watch the girls" or "you could put that book down and talk to me". Whatever she says, it forces me to be thinking about what she wants, and not what I want. It gives me an excuse to submit.</p></p>
<h3>2. Honey, what's on your mind?</h3></p>
<p>This question is even harder for me to ask than the first one. The one thing I value more than <strong>my time</strong> is <strong>my attention</strong>. I'm constantly thinking about what is going on at the church or about some message or something else and I'm sure quite often I leave my wife feeling starved for attention. By asking her "What's on your mind?" I am forcing myself into a conversation dictated <strong>by her</strong>.</p></p>
