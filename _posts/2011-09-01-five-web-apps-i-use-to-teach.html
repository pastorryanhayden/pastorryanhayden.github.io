<h3><a title="Typing Web" href="http://www.typingweb.com/">Typingweb.com</a></h3><br />
I teach a typing class and a computer class to junior high students. I think learning to type is fairly straightforward. Unfortunately, it involves a lot of repetitious drills. The hardest thing about teaching typing is assessment. In our class, most of our typing is done the old fashioned way, using typing books that were published when Bush was president (the first one).</p>

<p>In order to ease the confusion of tests and quizzes, I use a free service called typingweb. Typingweb is kind of like a stripped down Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing that is free and online. What's cool about typingweb is it allows you to set up a teacher portal, and assign usernames to all of your students. When they finish typing, the website gives me at a glance metrics including words per minute, typing time, accuracy and adjusted words per minute. Needless to say, it saves me a lot of math and cuts down on cheating.</li></p>

<h3><a title="Aviary Education" href="http://aviaryeducation.com">aviaryeducation.com</a></h3><br />
I have always wanted to teach students photoshop, but at $500 a copy, in an underfunded Christian school, its just never going to happen. Thankfully, because of a web app called aviary.com, that doesn't mean I can't teach them the basics and instill in them a love for graphic design and photo editing.<br />
When I first heard of Aviary, I had very low expectations. I mean, running a word processor in a browser is one thing, but a photoshop clone - impossible. I took a look at the program with this jaded perspective and closed it after only a minute or so. Recently, for some reason, I decided to open it back up, and boy was I surprised. There is a lot to love in this web app.</p>

<p>Basically you get a very paired down version of Photoshop. What you do get, however, is the good stuff: a very functional layers palette (with blend modes, grouping and opacity), the essential selection tools (lasso, marquee, and magic wand), and a very powerful color engine. If a student can learn on this free tool, they will be miles ahead of other photoshop noobs if they are ever fortunate enough to learn the program, but for many, this program is so awesome, they may never feel the need to learn photoshop.<br />
To add icing to the cake, aviary offers a free education portal, where I can assign projects to my class and see all of their work in one place - awesome!</li></p>

<h3><a title="Schoology" href="http://schoology.com">schoology.com</a></h3><br />
The two big names in online classroom software are Blackboard (a very expensive, popular option) and Moodle (a free option). I have spent a lot of time with Moodle and it was the first software I tried to get my class to use. When I discovered schoology, another classroom management system that is styled after popular social networks (read Facebook), I immediately abandoned moodle.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_61" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Click to enbiggen"]<a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Computer-Applications_-9th-Graders-Schoology.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-61" title="Computer Applications_ 9th Graders | Schoology" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2011/09/Computer-Applications_-9th-Graders-Schoology-300x179.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="179" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Schoology has a lot of advantages for me over moodle. For one, schoology doesn't have to be hosted on our schools server, which means I didn't have to set it up and configure it. Secondly, it looks better than any other Learning Management System I've used. Thirdly, its easy for students to learn, because it looks so much like Facebook, it is kind of second nature for them to jump in and start using it.</p>
<p>Below are some of the things I use schoology for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessment - I like giving online quizzes and tests, especially in computer class.</li>
<li>Review/Absentee work - I can post all of my teaching files (notes, powerpoint documents, maps, photos, etc.) for my students to access whenever they have a question. In classes like computer applications and Bible Survey, which don't have textbooks, this is a big help to me.</li>
<li>Assignments - I can post assignments and have the students turn them in via a "dropbox" that schoology provides. I then get to look at each assignment online and it makes grading a snap. Also, it allows the student to access their work anywhere they have an internet connection.</li><br />
</ul><br />

<h3><a title="Jupiter Grades" href="http://jupitergrades.com" target="_blank">jupitergrades.com</a></h3><br />

<p>Schoology has a built in grade book, but I prefer to use the free JupiterGrades. Having used several different grade book software suites, I have to say the simplicity of jupitergrades is like a breath of fresh air. I can take roll on my iPad by looking at a seating chart and tapping the empty seat (10 seconds), the grade book is super easy to use. I don't know what to say about this software but it works - I hope it stays free.</li></p>

<p>Evernote is a web app, but a lot more than just a web app. I use it for the classroom, but for a lot more than the classroom. Evernote is my digital filing cabinet, and it is the single most powerful tool in my paperless life arsenal. Evernote is a note collection app that allows you (once you've signed up for an account) to collect notes, tag them, and organize them into notebooks. It has the best search features of any program I have used (you can even search for text inside of photos) and there are free evernote apps available for almost anything (I use it on my mac, on windows, on my Palm Pre and on my iPad.) Your notes are completely private, but if you want, you can share notebooks with people. I could write a dozen blog posts about evernote, check the program out yourself.</li><br />
