<p>This week <a title="Reasons I Could Never Be Mainstream" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/reasons-i-could-never-be-mainline/">I&rsquo;ve written</a> about the things that I believe that would make me <em>persona non grata</em> in mainstream evangelicalism. This list was not intended to be a list of independent Baptist distinctives, nor was it intended to be an attack on those Christians who disagree with me. I was merely stating my positions on</p>

<p>I once heard a preacher say</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all been told at some point in our lives &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t just stand there, do something.&rsquo; Well I want to say &rsquo;Don&rsquo;t just do something, stand there.'&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
<strong>Don&rsquo;t just do something, stand there.</strong></p>

<p>Before I get on with what I intend to write about today - why I think being an Independent Fundamental Baptist is historically speaking a good place to be - I want to say something about this whole blog series.</p>
<p>I have not attacked anybody. I have not used a single crass word. This week I have just stated my position on four controversial subjects - separation, dress, music and Bible versions - and stated why I believe what I believe in those four areas.</p>

<p>I know there are people who read my blog who disagree with me on some if not all of those points. That&rsquo;s o.k., I accept that. I&rsquo;m glad you are here. What you will find here is <strong>my</strong> opinions. I&rsquo;m going to state why I do what I do and I&rsquo;m going to defend what I do on this blog. If you disagree with me on an issue, by all means jump in on the comments. We&rsquo;ll both learn from the dialogue. But, don&rsquo;t be surprised when you come to this site and find a defense of Independent Baptists. I am an independent Baptist. If you are in a Bible Church or Community Church or you are Southern Baptist or Presbyterian than by all means, stand up for what you are. Just don&rsquo;t feign shock when I do the same.</p>
<p>Rabbit trail over.</p>

<p><strong>I think, historically speaking, being an independent Fundamental Baptist is the best place to be on the Bible believing spectrum.</strong> If I thought otherwise, I would be elsewhere. But I don&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that there aren&rsquo;t some r<strong>eally dark IFB closets full of skeletons</strong>. There are. There were IFB leaders, some of the most revered ones, who were extremely flawed individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>J. Frank Norris was a narcissistic showman that did shoot a man in his office, have ties to the Klan, and made highly inflammatory racist statements.</li>
<li>There were early IFB leaders who believed in the <em>Protocols of Israel</em> and vocally supported Hitler early on. (Mordecai Ham, William Bell Riley)</li>
<li>The <em>Sword of the Lord</em> did publish articles opposing desegregation.</li>
<li>Bob Jones University did come out swinging hard on the wrong side of the race debate.</li>
<li>Jack Schaap was not even close to the first IFB leader who got caught in sexual abuse scandal.</li><br />
</ul><br />
I&rsquo;m not, in defending why I am a Independent Baptist, going to deny those things. If you take offense to my naming those things, do you think all the people trying to destroy Independent Baptists will spare any gory details? (They won't and don't, so why not hear it from a sympathetic voice.)</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/200px-J._Roach_Straton_and_J._Frank_Norris.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-908" alt="200px-J._Roach_Straton_and_J._Frank_Norris" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/03/200px-J._Roach_Straton_and_J._Frank_Norris.jpg" width="200" height="290" /></a></p>
<p>But despite some of the sour fruit in our family tree, I still think Independent Fundamental Baptist is the best place to be. Let me tell you why:</p>
<p><strong>Those scandals are not representative of the whole.</strong> &nbsp;There are millions of Independent Baptists. We are one of the biggest religious groups in the country. Never has one of the scandals above been characteristic of the whole or even most of the people in our group.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>we are independent</strong>. That is an adjective, not a noun. I have absolutely no control over what other IFB preachers do or say. You can call yourself and independent Baptist and believe that you have to have six toes and purple hair to be saved, and there is nothing I can do about it besides verbally oppose you and refuse to fellowship with you. There is no governing board of IFB churches. Unfortunately, that means me and Westboro Baptist Church can put the same subtitle on our church signs, and I can do nothing about it besides speak out against their ridiculousness and refuse to have anything to do with them.</p>
<p>But the main reason why I am glad to be an independent Baptist is because I think historically speaking, even despite the scandals in our ranks, independent Baptists have the best heritage of any group that I know of.</p>
<p><strong>Each of the words Independent Fundamental Baptist stand for something.</strong> Each were tacked on in the midst of their own historical conflicts, and in each case, I think independent Baptists were on the right side of history. Let&rsquo;s look at each of these in turn. Going in reverse order:</p>
<h3 id="baptist">Baptist</h3><br />
We could argue all day about when the Baptists came to be. I&rsquo;m of the opinion that there have always been people who believed like the Baptists. But I don&rsquo;t subscribe to Baptist <em>continuity</em>. You can trace our strain of Baptists back to the 1600&rsquo;s, and they really came to fruition in the years around the Great Awakening.</p>
<p>Most of these early Baptists came out of Congregational, Presbyterian or Anglican churches, and most of them came to their positions independently through reading the scriptures. These Baptists were harshly persecuted, at times whipped, disenfranchised, and imprisoned. They grew through this time of conflict because of their faithfulness and their biblical message.</p>
<p><strong>All of us, even non-baptists, owe a lot to these early Baptists.</strong> They were hugely influential in the passing of the Bill of Rights, and they are one of the main reasons we live in a land with religious liberty. Also, they evangelized the south and midwest, giving long term Christian influence to those areas.</p>
<h3 id="fundamental">Fundamental</h3><br />
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, controversy arose in churches over conflicts between &ldquo;science&rdquo; and the Bible. A group calling themselves <strong>modernists</strong> tried to go through the Bible and cut out all of the parts that disagreed with science. They took scientific approach to the authorship of the Bible, largely discrediting it. They were a huge cultural force.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/RiceJohnR.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-909" alt="RiceJohnR" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/03/RiceJohnR.jpg" width="144" height="204" /></a></p>
<p>But they were not Bible believers. Fundamentalists were those who rose up to drive them out of churches, and who decided to do &ldquo;battle royale&rdquo; for the fundamentals of the faith.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <em>fundamentalist</em> and <em>evangelical</em> were at one time synonyms. They were two names for the same group of people who were opposed to the liberalism in &ldquo;mainline&rdquo; protestant churches.</p>
<h3 id="independent">Independent</h3><br />
In the mid 1900&rsquo;s, the battles of the fundamentalists were still going on in the protestant conventions. In the Northern and Southern Baptist conventions, there were large groups of theologically conservative pastors who were trying to get the group as a whole to take a conservative theological position. The seminaries and missions arms of these conventions were hiring and promoting theological liberals and modernists. Many of the early Independent Baptists were Southern or Northern Baptists who were forced out of their conventions because of their constant stand against this. Over the course of twenty years or so, a very large group of conservative Baptists either left of their own volition or were forced out of the conventions because they didn&rsquo;t want their church to support what they saw (and I see) as heresy.</p>
<p>Some conservative people stayed in the conventions, and are still there. (Theologically conservative people mounted a &ldquo;takeover&rdquo; of the southern Baptist convention in the 1990&rsquo;s.) But I&rsquo;d still say that historically, I&rsquo;d want to stand with those who left with their conscience intact.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my church history context, and I&rsquo;m grateful for it. It&rsquo;s not been perfect, but it&rsquo;s still where I want to be. If you are Independent Baptist, I hope you know why. If you are not, I hope you know why and I hope you feel as strongly about it as I do.</p>
