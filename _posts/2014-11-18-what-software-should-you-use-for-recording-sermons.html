<p>Every church records sermons. &nbsp;At least every church I&rsquo;ve ever been a part of. &nbsp;They&rsquo;ve been doing it for years. &nbsp;Still - one &nbsp;of the most common tech questions I get is &ldquo;what software should we use in the soundbooth?"</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need that software to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record sermons</li>
<li>Save to MP3</li>
<li>Basic audio editing (remove bad spots, clip beggining and end, amplify, etc.)</li>
<li>Be easy enough for volunteers to learn quickly.</li><br />
</ul><br />
There are a bunch of programs that meet the first three requirements, the last one however, is a little illusive.</p>
<h3 class="">Expensive Programs</h3><br />
The two expensive programs you probably will encounter are&nbsp;<a title="" href="https://creative.adobe.com/products/audition" target="_blank">Adobe Audition</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="" href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/" target="_blank">Apple Logic</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(If you really want to get expensive, I&rsquo;m sure&nbsp;<a title="" href="http://www.avid.com/US/Products/ArtistSuite/detail.html#audio" target="_blank">Avid</a>&nbsp;has something too.) &nbsp;These programs are fantastic software programs - but they are aimed more at people running pro music studios than they are at Earl from the sound booth. &nbsp;99% of what they do - you don&rsquo;t need. &nbsp;They have complicated interfaces and a learning curve. &nbsp;Long story short - unless you have professional audio guys in the soundbooth and your church has lots of money to throw away, you should probably stay away from these programs.</p>
<h3 class="">Inexpensive Programs</h3><br />
One program I have used from time to time is a little app called KVLT. &nbsp;<a title="" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kvlt-audio-recorder/id457836165?mt=12" target="_blank">KVLT</a>&nbsp;is Mac only, available from the&nbsp;<a title="" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kvlt-audio-recorder/id457836165?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac app store</a>&nbsp;for $10. &nbsp;What I like about KVLT is that it is super simple. &nbsp;It records audio, lets you see the wave form, and lets you save it to any common extension. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p class=""><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kvlt-audio-recorder/id457836165?mt=12" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" title="" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/1416321830_thumb.png" alt="" align="left" /></a></p><br />
KVLT is a great app to own, and in the past I&rsquo;ve used it for making quick audio recordings. &nbsp;But it&rsquo;s probably a little too simple and because it&rsquo;s Mac only, might not suit your needs.</p>
<h3 class="">Free Programs</h3></p>
<h4 class=""><a title="" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a></h4></p>
<p class="">The most popular free audio app out there is&nbsp;<a title="" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;Audacity is a fantastic piece of open source software and is probably the program running in most church&rsquo;s soundbooths.</p></p>
<p class=""><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/1416321753_full.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" title="" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/1416321753_thumb.png" alt="" align="left" /></a></p><br />
Here&rsquo;s what Audacity has going for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s Free.</li>
<li>It will run on anything.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s super popular - so you can find lots of tutorials on it.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s very powerful - it does things like multitrack editing and has many advanced filters. &nbsp;These are things that you&rsquo;d have to spend a lot of money on the expensive stuff above to do.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Here is what I don&rsquo;t like about Audacity:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>It&rsquo;s ugly.</b> &nbsp;I mean really, really ugly. &nbsp;The main buttons look like they were designed by Fisher Price. &nbsp;In years of using Audicity, I&rsquo;ve waited and waited for a redesign - but it never comes.</li>
<li><b>It&rsquo;s intimidating.</b> &nbsp;Just like pro software, the vast majority of what Audacity does - your soundbooth will never do. &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s harder for non-tech-savvy volunteers to pick up.</li>
<li><b>It doesn&rsquo;t do MP3&rsquo;s out of the box</b>. &nbsp;You have to download and install extra software for that. &nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t a big deal, but it is annoying.</li>
<li><b>You can&rsquo;t just hit Command + S to save to MP3, you have to export</b>. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure there is a good reason for this, but I find it annoying.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<h1 class=""><a title="" href="http://www.ocenaudio.com.br/" target="_blank">Ocenaudio</a></h1><br />
My new favorite audio recording app is a less well known program called&nbsp;<a title="" href="http://www.ocenaudio.com.br/" target="_blank">Ocenaudio</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ocenaudio does much of what Audacity does (although it doesn&rsquo;t do multitrack.) &nbsp;What makes Ocenaudio my favorite is it&rsquo;s dead simple interface. &nbsp;The app couldn&rsquo;t get simpler - with just a waveform timeline, a row of good looking buttons, and a list of recent files (even that can get hidden.) &nbsp;If you can run iTunes, you can run Ocenaudio.</p>
<p class=""><a href="http://www.ocenaudio.com.br/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" title="" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/1416321639_thumb.png" alt="" align="left" /></a></p><br />
Also, unlike Audacity, Ocenaudio exports MP3 out of the box, and you can just save the file into whatever format you want. &nbsp;All of this translates into a program that volunteers from the soundbooth should have no problem with.</p>
<p>Ocenaudio is free and cross-platform (it will work on almost any computer.) &nbsp;Check it out today.</p>
<p>Below is a video walkthrough of these programs:</p>
