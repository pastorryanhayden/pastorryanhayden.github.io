<p>There is a gem in this month's <em>Sword of the Lord</em> (Yes, I still read parts of the <a href="http://www.swordofthelord.com"><em>Sword of the Lord</em></a>.) entitled <strong><em>The Fundamentalism of Yesterday, The Evangelicalism of Today, and the Fundamentalism of Tomorrow</em></strong>. It was written at least 35 years ago by a man named <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;field-author=Chester%20E%20Tulga&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AChester%20E%20Tulga">Chester Tulga </a>(He died in 1976, hence the "at least 35 years ago part.) The article is a condemnation of what was then contemporary fundamentalism.</p>
<p>While I didn't agree with the whole article, particularly the first part. (Although the distance of time and context open that first part up to a lot of misinterpretation) I found the last section, where Tulga prescribes what the fundamentalism of tomorrow must be, to be pure gold. Here are some gems:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The fundamentalism of tomorrow must submit to the authority of the Word of God. &nbsp;It is not enough to defend its inspiration; we must submit to it's authority. The authority of the Word of God must not be undermined by looks interpretation; it must not be perverted by unscrupulous interpretation; it must not be nullified by appealing to a mythical Holy Spirit who sets aside the authority of the Word of God.</blockquote><br />
He goes on</p>
<blockquote><p>The fundamentalism of tomorrow must preach the full Gospel, not the irreducible minimum of the Gospel, as some evangelicals put it; not the limited, streamlined Gospel of some evangelists; not the lowest common denominator message of the evangelical compromisers. We must preach the Gospel which honors the whole counsel of God, the Gospel which refuses to accommodate itself to false gospels, the Gospel which refuses all affinity with heresy, the Gospel that claims the blessing of the Holy Spirit by honoring the Word of God and refusing to join the deniers of the Son of God...</p>
<p>...The fundamentalism of tomorrow must return to the full gospel and proclaim the whole counsel of God, shunning the current abbreviations.</blockquote><br />
I found it interesting that <strong>even in the 1970s, there were preachers who realized that fundamentalism had a problem with fidelity to the scriptures, who saw that many fundamentalist had become their own authorities (and were claiming the power of the Spirit to supper it), and who understood that there were fundamentalists who were reducing the gospel to a powerless nothing. </strong>I wonder how much criticism Tulga faced for saying it then.</p>
<p>More than 35 years later, I'd say we are still struggling with those same things as a movement. I didn't expect to see that in the <em>Sword of the Lord</em>.</p>
