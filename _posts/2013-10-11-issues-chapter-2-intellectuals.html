<p><em>I know that I said that I would post a chapter every day, but I had my wisdom teeth extracted on Tuesday and haven't felt like doing anything. &nbsp;Actually, I didn't even open a computer in the last two days. &nbsp;But Sunday's coming so it's time to get back to real life. &nbsp;Here is chapter 2:</em></p>
<p>(In case you haven't read it, here is the link to the <a title="Help Me Finish My Book" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/help-finish-book/">introduction</a> and <a title="We&rsquo;ve Got Issues &ndash; We&rsquo;ve Abandoned Biblical Preaching" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wevegotissuespreaching/">chapter 1</a>)</p>
<h1>Issue 2: We&rsquo;ve Kicked Intellectuals to the Curb</h1></p>
<h2>The Ideal</h2></p>
<h3>Ideally, IFB pastors would realize that there is a type of knowlege that and intellect that is dead.</h3><br />
Jesus spent much of his earthly ministry railing against the excesses of the Scribes and Pharisees, two groups of religious people that emphasized learning. Paul described his preaching ministry to the Corinthians as being <em>"Not with enticing words of man's wisdom22."</em> In his letter to Timothy, he warned that there would be some who were <em>"ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of the truth.23"</em> He even told the Corinthians <em>"knowledge puffeth up24."</em></p>
<p>Every preacher needs to realize the danger of intellectual excess. Every age has had those who were willing to sit in their ivory tower and argue about how many angels can dance on the head of a needle and most of them have been a hinderance, not a help to the kingdom of God.</p>
<h3>Ideally, IFB pastors would realize that intellectual deficiency is just as wrong as intellectual excess.</h3><br />
Although scripture in a few places warns against intellectual excess, in far more places it adjures us to learning and knowledge. The first chapter of the book of Proverbs, for instance, teaches us that <em>&ldquo;the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge"_25 and that _"fools hate knowledge.26"</em> Throughout Proverbs, one of the antagonists is "the simple one". In the New Testament we see Paul correcting someone by saying they had zeal <em>"but not according knowledge.27&rdquo;</em> There are well over 100 positive references to knowledge and learning in scripture.</p>
<p>The very nature of scripture itself argues that knowledge is important. When God wanted to reveal his nature to man, he gave them a book, filled with ideas, written in sentences and paragraphs that had to be digested through the mind. And He wants us to think about it. <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Psalm1" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Psalm 1</a> says calls the man blessed who meditates in God's law day and night.</p>
<p>We must never forget that our Lord said <em>"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,"</em> but he didn't stop there, He added <em>"and with all thy mind.28"</em> God wants us to think and to use the mind that He has given us for His glory.</p>
<h3>Ideally, IFB pastors would realize that the call to the pastorate is the call to a lifetime of study.</h3><br />
Preachers are commanded to <em>"Study to shew thyself approved unto God"</em> so that we can be <em>"a workman, that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.29"</em> We are also required to be <em>"apt to teach30"</em>, a qualification that presupposes study and preparation. <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Timothy5%3A17" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Timothy 5:17</a> says <em>"Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine."</em> When the deacons were first chosen in <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Acts6" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Acts 6</a>, the apostles said to the church <em>"It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables."</em></p>
<p>Study is an intellectual exercise. Like any exercise, it is work, but it is the work to which pastors are called and it is necessary for the health of the church. As students, Pastors should first and foremost know their Bibles, <em>"comparing spiritual things with spiritual31"</em>, but we shouldn't stop there. In order to understand the Bible, the pastor needs to be a student of language and history. In order to apply the Bible in a way that is alive and real to the church, the pastor needs to be a student of current events.</p>
<p>In light of all this, it's hard to imagine a faithful pastor with hostility to learning.</p>
<h3>Ideally, IFB pastors would praise God for the gift of special people who he has gifted with wisdom and insight.</h3><br />
Two of the gifts of the spirit listed in <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians12" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 12</a> are <em>"the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge"</em>. While God requires all pastors to be students, he gives some people in each age who are especially gifted with wisdom and knowledge. Where would we be today had not God gifted William Tyndale with such a vast knowledge of languages and a desire to see God's word translated into the English tongue? Can we not praise God for the wisdom of men in the 1800s like Charles Spurgeon or F.B. Meyer whose pens have made so many things from God's word clear to us?</p>
<p>We are thankful to God that not every Christian is an intellectual. Church would be boring (and probably pretty empty) if that was the case. We can, however, also be thankful to God that he does bless the church with thinkers and learn from these people who God has gifted us with.</p>
<h2>The Reality</h2><br />
The reality today is that a big part of fundamentalism is intellectually bankrupt. Unfortunately, some of the worst read and most ignorant people I've ever met are called "pastor" by some Independent Baptist congregation. It defies reason that so many people tasked with studying a book as deep and wonderful as the Bible and delivering that knowledge to a congregation week after week cannot think for themselves or use language correctly.</p>
<p>Many fundamentalists are leery of any kind of learning. I know pastors who will only read books sold in the Hyles Anderson bookstore. I've heard from an increasing number of pastors some kind of argument against bible college education, usually for fear that <em>"knowledge puffeth up."</em> Even more have expressed to me the dangers of seminaries, even extremely conservative fundamental Baptist seminaries.</p>
<p>Some fundamentalist colleges are even anti-scholarship. There is a growing trend in fundamentalism for colleges to drop Greek and Hebrew courses from their catalogues. Traditional Bible College courses like Hermeneutics and Homiletics are being renamed "Bible Study" and "Preaching." Large numbers of books are blacklisted and students with questions are labelled rebels.32</p>
<p>The assumed purpose of all of this is to keep from some knowledge that leaders feel is dangerous to the faith. There are two problems with that, one philosophical and one practical:</p>
<p>The philosophical problem is this: Shouldn't the truth be able to stand on its own? If fundamentalism, King-James-onlyism, or whatever other "ism" is cherished by the leader is the true biblical position, shouldn't it be able to stand up to the honest questions of a few young people? This kind of a protective stance shows that a person isn't really settled in their faith in the first place and actually drives people to curiosity about what is so dangerous "out there."</p>
<p>The practical problem with this kind of walled garden approach to learning is that its just far too easy for young people to get whatever information they want in the twenty-first century and far too hard for leaders to keep things a secret. Various opinions and unlimited information is just a google search away from any curious minded and bored student. If your version of fundamentalism and biblical Christianity can't withstand a google search or a trip to the library, then how will it withstand the forces of Satan?</p>
<p>Speaking about this almost a century ago, J. Gresham Machen, one of our fundamentalist forefathers said:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Certainly a Christianity that avoids argument is not the Christianity of the New Testament. The New Testament is full of argument in defense of the faith. The Epistles of Paul are full of argument-no one can doubt that. But even the words of Jesus are full of argument in defense of the truth . . .Everywhere the New Testament meets objections fairly and presents the Gospel as a thoroughly reasonable thing.33"</blockquote><br />
Machen was writing during a time when books were expensive and the internet wasn't even a dream of science fiction, but I think the modern availability of information makes his words more, not less applicable.</p>
<p>Have Bible Believing Christians always been so weary of the intellect and learning? Absolutely not. From the very beginning we had intellectual leaders like the Apostle Paul and writers like Luke. All of us are aware of intellectual giants in in our spiritual history like William Tyndale, John Bunyan, William Carey and Jonathan Edwards. We read about early fundamentalists like B.B. Warfield, J. Gresham Machen, R.A. Torrey, James Gray, and Lewis Sperry Chafer who were intellectual giants. Is there, then, any historical clues to why fundamentalism tends to be so anti-intellectual today? I think there are:</p>
<h3>An Element of Revivalism</h3><br />
Christian history swings back and forth between two extremes: cold-dead intellectualism and revivalistic emotionalism. Every national revival that has ever come to the United States came during at a time when religion was controlled by spiritually dead egg heads. The First Great Awakening came and wrested the control of American religion from the dead hands of New England Puritans. The Second Great Awakening came and took control away from Old School Calvinists and Universalists. The revival of the D.L. Moody era came when mainline denominational religion was starting to move into modernism. By the time of the revival of the 1950's and 1960's, main-line denominational Christianity had wholly swallowed liberalism and as a consequence, that revival saw the rise of the Independent Baptist movement.34</p>
<p>Because one work of revivals is to correct some form of excessive intellectualism, and because the independent fundamental baptist movement was born out of one of those revivals, our movement has never been accused of falling anywhere near the intellectual extreme. On the contrary, anti-intellectualism is as much a feature of Independent Baptists as amens and tract racks.</p>
<h3>Fallout from anti-modernism</h3><br />
Early fundamentalists were fighting a battle against the theological modernism being propagated by seminaries. On top of accepting evolution, seminaries in the first half of the 1900s were (largely due to German influence) forwarding ideas critical of the inspiration of the Bible, dicing up it's supposed authorship, and denying every miracle from the crossing of the Red Sea to the virgin birth. As a natural result of this, many fundamentalists became weary of any higher learning and became radically anti-intellectual.</p>
<p>Billy Sunday, quite possibly the most famous and most imitated fundamentalist in the 1900s, is a great example of this. He would go around the country denouncing institutions of higher learning with as much crassness and vitriol as his audiences could stand. He'd throw out one liners like "I don't need no doctor to doctor my doctrine", &ldquo;seminaries turn out bottle fed preachers stuffed in theological molds&rdquo;, and &ldquo;academic types tried to tickle the palates of the giraffes with their high-sounding rhetoric while their sheep starved.&rdquo;35 Sometimes, in his enthusiasm for the defense of the faith, he'd even go so far as to say things like "I know less about doctrine than a jack rabbit knows about ping pong."</p>
<h3>Necessary for Populist Appeal</h3><br />
For all intensive purposes, theological liberalism is dead. Oh, it&rsquo;s true that there are still denominational churches in almost every town that are pastored by theological liberals, they long ago ceased to have much influence. (Imagine that - a church that attacks its own reason for being becoming irrelevant!) Despite the death of liberalism as a threat in modern churches, the anti-intellectual rhetoric never really went away. Why? I think it&rsquo;s just because people like it.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever been to high school in the United States could tell you that there are plenty of Americans that get a sense of joy by picking on smart people. There is a rapport to be gained by a pastor with his people (in some areas) by picking on those nerds in higher education. Modernism has been dead for a while, but it keeps getting burned as a straw man because doing so rallies the troops and costs nothing.</p>
<h2>How do we fix this?</h2></p>
<h3>Call intellectual laziness what it is.</h3><br />
If we are going to keep the anti-intellectual tendencies in our churches at bay, we cannot continue to promote preachers and teachers who do not study and read. There are many calling where someone who hates reading and study can fit in, the pastoral ministry should not be one of them. Let&rsquo;s be honest, long meandering sermons, rabbit trails, hobby horses, and the oft repeated &ldquo;I was going to preach on something else today, but I feel the spirit moving me in a different direction&rdquo; are too often just symptoms of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t-want-to-studyitus&rdquo;. It takes hard work for a preacher to preach 3 or 4 Bible messages a week, if it is hard work you don&rsquo;t want to do, find another ministry.</p>
<h3>Learn to value those to whom God has given superior intellect and wisdom.</h3><br />
If God gifts some Christians with wisdom and knowledge, then lets encourage those people to use their spiritual gifts, not treat them with continual suspicion. In order to properly defend the faith against the attacks of Satan, we need the insight of smart, thinking people. Thinking people ask questions, and they take time to come solidly to their conclusions. So when bright young people ask tough questions, let&rsquo;s try to answer them as openly as possible. As long as their exists in some sections of fundamentalism an idea gestapo, young people are going to be fleeing to the free world, whether the ideas are better there or not. If, as I believe it is, the Independent Baptist position is the closest to Scripture, then it will stand up to their questions.</p>
<h3>Stand up against the devil where he is actually attacking today.</h3><br />
There are many fundamentalist who will rail on modernism and liberals, but couldn&rsquo;t tell you what the emerging church is, couldn&rsquo;t tell you a thing about the &ldquo;say it and claim it&rdquo; theology of Joel Osteen and Joyce Meyer, have no idea what postmodernism is, know very little about the church growth movement and have little ammunition to use against the excessive Calvinism of John Piper and R.C. Sproul. We need people who will stand for biblical truth against error, but we need people who will fight today&rsquo;s battles, not rehash battles that have been over for nearly 75 years. As Martin Luther is often quoted as saying &ldquo;If I profess, with the loudest voice and the clearest exposition, every portion of the truth of God except precisely that little point which the world and the devil are at that moment attacking, I am not confessing Christ. . .. Where the battle rages the loyalty of the soldier is proved;&rdquo; 36</p>
<h3>Be conscious of collateral damage.</h3><br />
In attacking the modernistic seminaries of the late 1800s and early 1900s fundamentalist leaders ended up alienating a generation of young Bible scholars. When we attack error, we need to do it as fairly as possible. If you cut out a tumor with an axe, you might do more harm then good. The tumor needs to be removed, but how much better is it to do it with a scalpel instead. Let&rsquo;s be careful in our necessary and zealous defense of the faith, not to through out the baby with the bathwater.</p>
