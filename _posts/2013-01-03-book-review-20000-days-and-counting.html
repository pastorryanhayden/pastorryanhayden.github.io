<p>The premise behind <a href="http://www.amazon.com/20-000-Days-Counting-Mastering/dp/0849948541/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357263536&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=20%2C000+days+and+counting">20,000 Days and Counting</a> was when the author, Robert Smith, realized he had lived roughly half of his life (20,000 days) and wanted to approach the rest of his life with some kind of a plan. He booked a hotel room for two days, wrote a bunch of emails, and wrote out several principles for living and they are the soul of this book. The book is short, the author is&nbsp;likable&nbsp; and there are a few worthwhile life management nuggets in this book. I especially enjoyed the short chapter on overcoming the fear of rejection, because I think it is helpful for evangelism.<br />
Overall, though, the book is a very ordinary leadership/self help book. While I&rsquo;m glad I read it, it&rsquo;s not the kind of thing I&rsquo;m going to be buying copies of for my friends. I was a little let down by it.<br />
One of the things I&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;care for in this book was that it was hard to pinpoint where the author was coming from theologically. At first it seems he is writing from an evangelical christian perspective, and a few chapters in he even references the life story of William Borden. Yet, halfway through the book, he speaks glowingly of &ldquo;The Power of Positive&rdquo; thinking, which is certainly not an evangelical book.<br />
I&rsquo;m no hater of the self-help genre.&nbsp;I've&nbsp;read and reread the works of Stephen Covey and John Maxwell, and I&rsquo;ve read most of the bestselling business leadership books of the last decade. When I read one, I&rsquo;m at least expecting something new. I&nbsp;didn't&nbsp; get that from 20,000 days.</p></p>
<p>My copy of this book was provided for free from booksneeze.com. I was not required to write a positive review.</p></p>
