<p>Imagine for a second that you have a brother who is in the NFL. Ever since he was 10 years old - playing in the NFL has been his dream and passion. When other kids spent their spring evening watching Spongebob - your brother was down in the basement lifting weights or out for a run. Towards the end of high school, his dedication started to pay off - but he had a long way to go. He made his way onto a college team - but had to struggle against dozens of other players just to get off of the practice roster and onto the real team. He approached this with hard work and discipline, and eventually it paid off. After a solid college career - he decided he wanted to be in the NFL. Not being a standout, he was drafted very late, and soon found himself in the same situation as college - stuck on a practice squad with little chance of getting off. But he worked hard, waking up early to study film. Showing up to the weight room hours before practice. Diligently watching his eating habits. Finally, the coaches noticed and gave him a starting spot. After several seasons struggling and several close calls, his team finally made it into the Super Bowl, where he helped his team win a narrow, hard fought victory.</p>
<p>The brother I just described mirrors the majority of the players on any team in the NFL. Several dozen unbelievably determined and hard working people who are somebody&rsquo;s brother, son, cousin or uncle and who are striving unbelievably hard to achieve their dream. The vast majority of them weren&rsquo;t college phonemes and weren&rsquo;t expected to make much of themselves in the pros. They show up each year in March and work long hours through January, much of which is away from home. They make sacrifices to keep their bodies in tip top shape. They open themselves up to media scrutiny. Most of them are paid well - but nowhere near as well as the ones you hear about in the news.</p>
<p>But if this brother, cousin, uncle or son happens to play for the New England Patriots - then none of that hard work matters to you. No - he&rsquo;s a cheatriot, a patsy, a reproach to the game. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that, even if the patriots did cheat, the vast majority of these players had nothing to do with it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that for most of these players - this is their first trip to the super bowl (only Wilfork and Brady were on the last Super Bowl winning team.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you hate the Patriots. I despise the Yankees for very similar reasons that most of the country despises the Patriots. The pretty boy frontman, the large northeast market, the national attention and most of all, the wins. I get it. It&rsquo;s not fair that one team should have so much success over such a long period of time - they are easy to root against. So I get it. I don&rsquo;t begrudge you for despising the patriots. If I were in your shoes, I would too.</p>
<p>But belittling everything they do, constantly accusing them of cheating, and insisting that an &ldquo;asterisk&rdquo; be put next to their accomplishments, that&rsquo;s going a bit too far. If one of those nameless players was your brother, or you, you would want people to wait till the facts came in before they passed judgment. You&rsquo;d want people to show at least some interest in the other side of the story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the Patriots fans who comes by it honestly. I have fond memories of running around my backyard as a six year old in a tiny Patriots jersey and helmet. At almost every family getogether (in Massachusetts), we sat around a large table and traded predictions about the Patriots. My grandfather (actually, my stepdad&rsquo;s dad) still braves the elements a couple times a year to go to the games.</p>
<p>I live in Illinois now and I&rsquo;m not into sports. I may watch a total of five sports games a year. But all of them are Patriots games. It&rsquo;s the only sports team I care about.</p>
<p>Yet - I have preacher friends who have a big problem with that. I&rsquo;ve had people - albeit nameless anonymous people - try to make it seem like I was lacking in moral character because I&rsquo;m a patriots fan. It&rsquo;s ridiculous. The facts aren&rsquo;t even in yet.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we do know:</p>
<ul>
<li>We know that the NFL is doing an investigation, which is being led by a long time Pat&rsquo;s hater and was pushed for by two teams that got beat by the Patriots in the playoffs and who were both involved in serious controversies this year and no doubt loving the fact that the heat has turned to the leagues favorite team to hate.</li>
<li>We know that an ESPN reporter published false information about the Patriots (11 of 12 balls TWO POUNDS under) that was repeated by everyone for two weeks.</li>
<li>We know that almost every story about Deflategate was sensationalized to make the Patriots look bad. When it comes out that the NFL had questions about an old man, who stopped in a bathroom for less than two minutes with the footballs (this footage was provided by the patriots and is literally the only moments footballs weren&rsquo;t on camera) the media runs it as &ldquo;mysterious patriots personnel being questioned for allegedly taking the balls into a mysterious room.&rdquo;</li>
<li>We know that the referees handled allegedly unfair footballs during every single play and apparently saw nothing wrong with them.</li>
<li>We know that Bill Bellicheck&rsquo;s explanation actually holds it&rsquo;s air. That several experiments have been conducted and prestigious scientists from places like MIT and Carnegie Mellon have backed him up. (Although, Seahawks fan Bill Nye is a naysayer.)</li>
<li>We know that we have no idea what the effects on the Colts balls was because no one checked them at the end of the game and we don&rsquo;t blame them because, no one ever in history cared about football air pressure until two weeks ago.</li>
<li>We know that, even if the footballs were at 10.5 psi, that this would have almost zero effect on the game, and could even have a negative effect.</li>
<li>We also know that, since 2007 (8 years ago) when the Patriots were caught doing something against the rules (which actually wasn&rsquo;t against the rules until the next season - but they shouldn&rsquo;t have been doing it.) That dozens of ridiculous cheating accusations have been pointed at the patriots - 0 of which have been able to stick.</li><br />
</ul><br />
So to sum it up - we know&hellip;nothing, but we know enough to at least be doubtful about Deflategate. For the millions fans who are guilty of nothing other than being born in an area with a good football team, and for the dozens of players who worked unbelievably hard to get to the Super Bowl this year. Can we at least give it a rest until the actual facts come in?</p>
<p>I may be guilty of being a jaded and prejudiced New England Patriots fan. I&rsquo;m trying not to be. Can you at least admit that you may be a jaded and prejudiced Patriots detractor - and reserve judgment until there is proof that the patriots did tamper with footballs. And if it is proven that they did, in your judgement can you try to remember or at least acknowledge the dozens of Patriots players and millions of fans who had nothing to do with it?</p>
<p>This is my first and hopefully last article on sports. Troll away.</p>
