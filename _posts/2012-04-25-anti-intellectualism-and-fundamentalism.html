Billy Sunday</blockquote><br />
Ignorance is not a virtue. While there is always the danger of pride in learning, we are commanded as preachers to <em>"study to shew thyself approved unto God, rightly dividing the word of truth."</em> Paul commanded Timothy to <em>"give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."</em></p>
<p>The apostle Paul was knowledgeable about the issues of his day, about current literature, and most of all, about the scriptures and doctrine. His writing was terse, logical, and sometimes verbose. Though a man of action, he was definitely an intellectual.</p>
<p>Yet if you were to comb the ranks of fundamentalists today, you would be hard pressed to find many intellectuals. Fundamentalist publications, fundamentalist colleges, and popular fundamentalist leaders all revel in a form of anti-intellectualism. Anti-intellectualism is as much a part of the fabric of modern fundamentalism as hymn books or the King James Bible. This is really scary.</p>
<p>If you were to go back in time, say, before 1870, you wouldn't find many faithful professing christians displaying anti-intellectualism. To be uneducated back then was dishonorable. Leaders were thinkers. Imagining Jonathan Edwards, John Wesley, or even Charles Spurgeon fitting in in modern fundamentalism is difficult. Even uneducated preachers of earlier years, men like John Bunyan and John Newton, were serious students of the word.</p>
<p>"Oh", you say, "but the apostles were mostly fisherman."</p>
<p>True. But have you read 1 Peter, or 2 John? The apostles may not have been members of the ancient inteligencia, but they knew their Bibles, put thought into their speech, and knew how to string a sentence together. They were both thinkers and doers.</p>
<p>So where did this anti-intellectualism come from?</p>
<p>Here is my theory, take it or leave it.</p>
<p>Fundamentalism first came about as an opposition movement. Fundamentalists were opposing the influx of "Modernism": ideas spreading throughout established religion mostly through the influence of seminaries. While some fundamentalists, like Princeton professor J. Gresham Machen, sought to combat this error through scholarly engagement, it wasn't the intellectuals who were the most magnetic and who drew the biggest crowds. It was fundamentalist "evangelists", and none were more well known and liked than William Asher Sunday.</p>
<p>Billy Sunday's attacks against modernism usually came through attacks against seminarians and intellectuals. While attacking modernism and evolution coming out of seminaries, he shot with birdshot, not bullets, and came across as extremely anti-intellectual. His harsh tone, his crude speech, his love of strung together insulting adjectives, his one liners, all of these alienated intellectuals. Quips like:</p>
<blockquote><p>"academic types tried to tickle the palates of the giraffes with their high-sounding rhetoric while their sheep starved"</blockquote><br />
or</p>
<blockquote><p>"seminaries turn out bottle fed preachers stuffed in theological molds"</blockquote><br />
or</p>
<blockquote><p>"I don't need to have some doctor to doctor my doctrine".</blockquote><br />
This method accomplished its goal of charging up the troops against modernism, but it also pushed intellectuals from the camp of the revivalism and thus largely out of fundamentalism.</p>
<p>"Well that was 100 years ago, what does it mean today?"</p>
<p>You can trace an unbroken line from Sunday to J. Frank Norris and from Norris to men like Jack Hyles and Lester Rolloff, and from them to Curtis Hutson, Shelton Smith, Jack Schaap and the like. The further down the historical chain you go, the further entrenched the anti-intellectualism.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that Sunday, and those who followed him didn't do great things for the Lord or that they weren't God called preachers. It just means a negative side effect of their ministries was the presence anti-intellectualism in fundamentalism.</p>
<p>And here's the thing: the Bible doesn't jive well with anti-intellectualism. The Bible is a book of truths; truths presented in ideas that have to be understood in sentences and words. To be a student of the Bible is to be a student of language and a student of history. The farther we get away from this study of context (which cannot exist in an environment of anti-intellectualism), the farther we get away from the true meaning of the Bible, and the more we open ourselves up to doctrinal and practical error.</p>
<p>We need to be aware of the dangers of intellectualism, but we also need to see the grave danger of throwing the baby out with the bath water.</p>
