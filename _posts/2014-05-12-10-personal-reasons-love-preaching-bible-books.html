<p>Over the last three years, I&rsquo;ve preached through the books of Exodus, 1 Corinthians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Ruth and 1 Peter. Those are just the books I&rsquo;ve completed. On Sunday mornings, I&rsquo;ve been preaching through the book of Matthew for 2 and a half years (We're in chapter 26) and for the last ten weeks I&rsquo;ve been doing a Wednesday night Bible study through Leviticus. (We are in chapter 17.)</p>
<p>I love preaching through Bible books. I love it more now than I did when I first started. There are so many things I could say about it. &nbsp;Here are my top ten reasons:</p>
<h3>1. It helps me to emphasize what scripture emphasizes.</h3><br />
When you preach through books of the Bible, if you are careful, you are letting the Bible direct your emphasis. It allows you to emphasize what the Bible emphasizes.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this brings enormous perspective. Certain themes come up over and over and over again (Like Jesus, grace, faith, etc.) and certain themes just don&rsquo;t. You begin to look around and think &ldquo;Why are they spending so much time on that? The Bible never makes it a point of emphasis.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a huge benefit that&rsquo;s hard to get if you are not plodding through books of the Bible.</p>
<h3>2. It helps me not to take scripture out of its context.</h3><br />
When you are looking at a verse in the context of the whole chapter or book, it makes it really hard to get away with taking it out of it&rsquo;s context. I mean, I still could, but the smart people in the congregation will see it right away.</p>
<p>Along a similar line, preaching through books of the Bible keeps me from presenting false doctrine. It&rsquo;s really easy when preaching topically to make a big doctrinal deal about one verse and to totally skip over the the balance the rest of the chapter or paragraph brings to the equation. When preaching through books of the Bible, you can&rsquo;t get away with that as easily.</p>
<h3>3. It keeps me from a crisis mentality.</h3><br />
Because I am preaching verse by verse, I don&rsquo;t feel pressured to hit a home run every week. I&rsquo;m not chasing some emotional high every Sunday. Every Sunday doesn&rsquo;t have to be a &ldquo;come to the altar&rdquo; crisis.</p>
<p>My goal is to teach people what God&rsquo;s Word says. To feed my flock. I&rsquo;m trusting God&rsquo;s Word to work in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>That takes a ton of pressure off of me.</p>
<h3>4. It keeps me from "hobby horse"ing.</h3><br />
This one&rsquo;s huge. I might be fed up with something I see in the world around me. I might be livid at some theological trend or upset about some political developement, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean our church people need to hear about it. It is <em>&ldquo;all scripture&rdquo;</em> which when taught and preached will make them <em>&ldquo;perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It is so easy to use my congregation to grind my axe, and I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve never done it, but my commitment to preaching through books of the Bible does more to keep me from doing it all the time than anything else.</p>
<h3>5. It helps our people learn the Bible.</h3><br />
The people in our church are learning the Bible! They are learning prophecy, they are learning doctrine, they are learning Bible history, they are learning how the parts of the Bible fit together. They are learning how to study the Bible for themselves. They are learning about the importance of context. They are learning how often scripture is forced to mean something it obviously doesn&rsquo;t in the context of a book.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a more effective way of teaching people the Bible than preaching through books of the Bible.</p>
<h3>6. It forces me to deal with things I wouldn&rsquo;t.</h3><br />
I&rsquo;ve been preaching through Matthew for 2 1/2 years. Recently, I came to the Olivet Discourse, Jesus description of the end times. I am the farthest thing from a prophecy geek. Honestly, I avoid prophecy like the plague. If I were just picking my own topics from sunday to sunday, I&rsquo;d probably never go into detail about prophecy. But because I&rsquo;m preaching through the book of Matthew, I couldn&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to skip chapter 24-25 because they are prophecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would you believe I&rsquo;ve had several people come to me and say &ldquo;Pastor, I really am enjoying this series on prophecy. It&rsquo;s helping me to understand parts of the Bible I never understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preaching through books of the Bible I&rsquo;ve had to deal with sex, divorce, modesty, false doctrines and many other topics that probably would be on my &ldquo;avoid&rdquo; list.</p>
<h3>7. It allows me to preach on difficult topics without seeming to pick on people.</h3><br />
There have been several times in the last few years where the text for the week has been on divorce, or on fornication, or whatever and there were people in our congregation that really needed to hear a sermon on that topic. Now, if I just said, today we are going to talk about divorce, because some of you need it. I would look like a bully. Because I was preaching through books, people just think, that&rsquo;s what the next verse is about. What was he going to do? Skip it?</p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me at how God works it out that I deal with uncomfortable topics just when they are needed.</p>
<h3>8. It gives me the opportunity to teach topically.</h3><br />
This one may seem counterintuitive, so let me explain. There have been several passages we&rsquo;ve gotten to which have given me the opportunity to slow down and teach a topical series. We spent, for example, several months in the Ten Commandments, and several months looking at each word in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 (the description of what love does). In both cases, and in several others, it was topical preaching, but bible-directed topical preaching that was sensitive to the context it came from.</p>
<h3>9. It frees me to study the Bible.</h3><br />
I have experienced the preacher&rsquo;s dilemma. When you are hunting desperately through the Bible, looking for something to preach. I know myself personally, if I was just going to preach topically week to week, that I&rsquo;d spend a good part of every week in &ldquo;what to preach&rdquo; mode. Preaching through books of the Bible allows me to actually study the Bible, rather than read the Bible desperately looking for something to preach next service.</p>
<h3>10. It changes me.</h3><br />
Of all of the reasons I love expository preaching, this is my favorite. My mind has been changed about things by preaching through the Bible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of preachers boasting &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been preaching for twenty years and haven&rsquo;t changed a thing.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s great for them, but I can&rsquo;t say that. What I can say is that every time I start a Bible study, I know some preconception of mine is going to be greatly challenged, and God is going to work on my heart.</p>
<p>Plodding through scripture will humble you like nothing else. It&rsquo;s a constant reminder of how far you have to go, and how high God&rsquo;s standard is.</p>
<hr />
<p>In conclusion, let me say, I&rsquo;m not against topical preaching. All preachers are topical preachers, if they say they aren&rsquo;t, they are kidding themselves. I&rsquo;m not against topical preaching, but for the reasons above, I&rsquo;m 100% for preaching through books of the Bible.</p>
<p>Did I miss a reason - let me know in the comments.</p>
