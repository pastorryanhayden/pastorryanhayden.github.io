<p>The other day, I was having a conversation with a lady in my home school group. She was talking about how her family had been looking for a new church. After complaining about immodesty, a rock concert atmosphere in many churches, and a lack of children in the church she&rsquo;s at, I said &ldquo;How come you never visited our church? It sounds like it may be a perfect fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her answer was something I&rsquo;ve heard many times lately: &ldquo;No offense but, I grew up in independent Baptist churches and there is no way I&rsquo;d ever visit one again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, here is a family that wants biblical christianity. They want to raise their children &ldquo;in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.&rdquo; They want a church where the word is taught and preached. They are totally unsatisfied with their current situation - but they are turned off by a terrible experience with independent Baptist churches.</p>
<p>Could it be, that there were legitimate problems that turned her off? Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>An unbalanced emphasis</li>
<li>Worship of preachers</li>
<li>A mean spirit</li>
<li>A lack of biblical depth in preaching</li>
<li>An infidelity to the Bible in preaching</li><br />
</ul><br />
The list could go on. I&rsquo;d say there is at least a 50-50 chance she encountered all or at least most of those things in her prior experience with the independent Baptist movement. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t blame her moving on and I don&rsquo;t blame her for carrying a negative stereotype of independent Baptists.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s past time we did something about it.</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a biblical fundamentalist. That means I believe I have a God given responsibility to stand for the truth and against error. I believe in a mandate for ecclesiastical separation. I believe in earnestly contending for the faith once delivered to the saints.</p>
<p>I will and have stood against errors in other groups. My church is independent in part to keep us separated from doctrinal error.</p>
<p>But more and more, I feel the need to stand against error in my own movement. There is a wing of our movement that is off the rails of biblical Christianity. It could never be honestly described by passages like 2 Timothy 2:24, 1 Corinthians 13:4-7, and James 3:17-18. This movement may be &ldquo;on fire&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s not the fire of the burning bush, that burns without consuming, it&rsquo;s the fire of General Sherman, that leaves a trail&nbsp;of destruction in it&rsquo;s wake.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve taken a stand on this blog. I&rsquo;ve spoken up for what the Bible clearly teaches. I&rsquo;ve spoken against things like unbiblical preaching, preacher worship, factionalism and meanness. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve also taken a stand in our church. There are a lot of independent Baptist youth meetings my church will not attend. There are IFB schools that have zero chance of sending a tour group to my church while I&rsquo;m the pastor. There are IFB evangelists that not only will never get invited to my church, but I will do my best to insulate my people from their influence in any way I can.</p>
<p>I consider myself a moderate fundamentalist and I&rsquo;m a radical moderate. A separatist moderate. An outspoken moderate. Not because I enjoy fighting but because my allegiance is to the truth.</p>
<p>We have a choice. We can be biblical fundamentalists who stand for the truth and against error wherever it is found, or we can be IFB partisans, protective or willingly ignorant of excesses within our ranks to the point where we will hear no criticism. We can be one or the other, but we cannot be both.</p>
<p>God did not give us the independent fundamental Baptist movement. God gave us the Truth contained in His word. That&rsquo;s an important distinction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an independent Baptist because I think they have been the most faithful to God&rsquo;s word. But my allegiance is to God&rsquo;s word. Not to some &ldquo;movement.&rdquo; When a movement and God&rsquo;s word don&rsquo;t line up, I&rsquo;m going with the word every time.</p>
<p>We have a responsibility to stand for the truth and against error. We have been very faithful at doing this to people on our &ldquo;left&rdquo; and to people &ldquo;outside&rdquo; of us. But we have a blind spot. We are reluctant to stand against the error of those who posture themselves to our &ldquo;right&rdquo; and of those who consider themselves &ldquo;inside&rdquo; of us.</p>
<p>When a southern Baptist or non-denominational church goes into error, we have no problem pointing it out. When an independent Baptist church goes into error, we turn a blind eye, proving that independent isn&rsquo;t an adjective, it&rsquo;s a meaningless word on our church sign.</p>
<p>That lady in my home school group no longer sees independent as an adjective - she probably has good reason for that.</p>
<p>So we have a choice. We can be biblical fundamentalists, allegiant to the truth or we can be IFB partisans, allegiant to a movement.</p>
<p>Do you see error? What are you doing about it? Are you a biblical fundamentalist or an IFB partisan.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be both.</p>
