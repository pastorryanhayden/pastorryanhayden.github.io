<p>Dear church family,</p>
<p>Wednesday evening, I preached a pretty hard message. Not hard in the sense that I was screaming a lot and pointing fingers, but hard in the sense that it was a difficult thing to hear. The main things I said were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Our church, based on it&rsquo;s average age, must start reaching younger people if we want to survive past the next ten years.</strong> Right now, the vast majority of our members are over 55, which means that if nothing changes, in ten years the vast majority of our members will be over 65 and retired. We won&rsquo;t be able to support a pastor, to support missionaries, etc.. If we want our kids and grandkids to have a Bible Baptist Church, it&rsquo;s absolutely essential that we start reaching young people and young families.</li>
<li><strong>Our church has a stigma.</strong> We may not deserve it, but it&rsquo;s definitely there. People who know anything about our church know us as a quirky family church that isn&rsquo;t particularly welcoming to people not like us. Stigmas take a long time to form and a long time to die. The only way we can do it is by living out the fruits of the Spirit.</li>
<li><strong>Our church has to get very intentional about our mission of reaching our area.</strong> We have a God-given mission of preaching the gospel to every creature in Mattoon and making disciples of those that respond. Second only to faithfulness to Christ that has to be our main priority.</li>
<li><strong>Our church needs to embrace the mess and change that are necessary byproducts of progress.</strong> Proverbs 14:4 says <em>&ldquo;Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.&rdquo;</em> A layman&rsquo;s 21st century translation of that would be this: You can&rsquo;t have progress without a mess, so make the progress and clean up the mess. Reaching people will bring new problems into our church. It will demand changes be made (like <em>&ldquo;where will we put them?&rdquo;</em>) that may shake us out of our comfort zone. But we have to do it anyway, because that is what we have been called to do.</li><br />
</ul><br />
As your pastor, I&rsquo;m leading you to make some big changes. They aren&rsquo;t changes to our message and they aren&rsquo;t an embrace of carnal methods, but they aren&rsquo;t <em>comfortable</em> or <em>familiar</em> either. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your regular Sunday school classes will be disbanded for the summer, and the Sunday schedule will be tweaked too.</li>
<li>We are bringing in new laborers into our ministry.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to ask you to give time and effort to both soul winning efforts and special days.</li>
<li>Some of you may have to give up things you&rsquo;ve been doing for years.</li><br />
</ul><br />
I know it won&rsquo;t be easy.</p>
<p>Here is how I view it-you can have one of two pastors: <strong>I can be a hospice nurse or I can be a doctor</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>A hospice nurse&rsquo;s job is to make you as comfortable as possible as you die in familiar surroundings.</em> As your pastor, I could change nothing and try nothing and let nature slowly take it&rsquo;s course. We&rsquo;d be comfortable, but we would also be dying and we wouldn&rsquo;t be fulfilling our purpose.</li>
<li><em>A doctor on the other hand prescribes medicine or performs surgery in an attempt to keep you alive and make you healthy.</em> Doctor&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t make you comfortable. Sometimes they make you feel temporarily more sick, they may even cut you, but through that they get you better and healthy.</li><br />
</ul><br />
<strong>I don&rsquo;t want to be a hospice nurse pastor</strong>. I truly believe that God is <del>going to do</del> doing great things through our church. I truly believe that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">our best days are in the future</span>.</p>
<p>We <strong><em>can</em></strong> become a healthy and growing church. It may be a painful and uncomfortable experience. But it&rsquo;s very necessary and very worth it.</p>
<p>Love you church. Can&rsquo;t wait to see you on the 13th.</p>
<p>Pastor</p>
