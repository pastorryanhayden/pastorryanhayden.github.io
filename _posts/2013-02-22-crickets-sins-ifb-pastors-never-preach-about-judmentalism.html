<p>We all have blind spots. Every religious group and movement has a tendency to explain away some passages of scripture. I am not advocating that, I am just stating that as a fact. Let me suggest a passage that we as Independent Baptists almost universally explain away:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.&rdquo;</em> (Matthew 7:1&ndash;2)</blockquote></p>
<h3 id="but">But&hellip;</h3><br />
All of us live in a <strong>&ldquo;don&rsquo;t judge me man&rdquo;</strong> society where pseudo-tolerance has become the official religion. (I say pseudo-tolerance because there is actually a long list of things our society is not tolerant of, chief among them biblical Christianity.) As a result, all of us who are striving to be biblical Christians have been falsely accused of being judgmental.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/scale.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-762" alt="scale" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/scale-300x223.jpg" width="300" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>So I get it. I understand that this is a sensitive issue. I understand that there are lots of people pulling this passage out of context and using it as a weapon against what is right. <strong>But we don&rsquo;t get to completely ignore a verse of scripture because some people are abusing it</strong>. It still has an intended meaning, it&rsquo;s still part of the <em>&ldquo;all scripture&rdquo;</em> that will make us <em>&ldquo;perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h3 id="considerthecontext.">Consider the context.</h3><br />
The Sermon on the Mount (where this command is found) is a study in contrast. It contrasts true Christianity with the religion of the scribes and pharisees (See Matthew 5:20). Just about everything between Matthew 5:20 and the end of Matthew 7 makes some form of comparison and illusion to the pharisees.</p>
<p>So who were these Pharisees?</p>
<p>The Pharisees were a group of people that, after their return from captivity, made the decision that God&rsquo;s law was going to be their law, and that they were going to separate themselves from evil, wickedness and idolatry. (The Hebrew word Pharisee was derived from means &ldquo;to separate.&rdquo;) In every religious and theological debate, they took the most conservative application. There was a translation battle going on in the days of Christ (over whether the Septuagint was valid) and the Pharisees were opposed to the new translation. They were the champions inspiration, preservation, and application of scripture. <em>&nbsp;(If you haven't already, I challenge any Bible believer to research the Pharisees.)</em></p>
<p><em>Anyone else see a parallel here?</em></p>
<p>The Pharisees were the fundamentalists of their day. That&rsquo;s not to say that they were wrong for championing the truth and insisting on it&rsquo;s application, but it does tell us that there are pitfalls to being a Bible believer that we need to carefully avoid. One of which, according to Matthew 7:1, is judgmentalism.</p>
<h3 id="whatjudgmentalismisnt.">What judgmentalism isn&rsquo;t.</h3><br />
By comparing scripture with scripture, we can be sure to know what <em>&ldquo;judge not&rdquo;</em> does not mean.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s not judgmental to affirm God&rsquo;s judgement on sin.</strong> If God says something is a sin in the Scripture, we are not being judgmental when we say it is a sin too, we are merely affirming what God has already judged. It is not, for example, judgmental for me to say that a person living in adultery is in sin. God has already made that judgment, I am just affirming it.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s not judgmental to inspect fruit.</strong> Jesus said in this same chapter &ldquo;<em>by their fruit you shall know them.&rdquo;</em> Expecting saved people to live a saved life and to be trying to gain victory over sin is not being judgmental. On the contrary, it is commanded by God.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<h3 id="sowhatdoesitmean">So what does it mean?</h3><br />
I think we can be judgmental in a couple of ways:</p>
<h4 id="whenwepointoutthesininothersandignorethesininuswearebeingjudgmental.">When we point out the sin in others and ignore the sin in us, we are being judgmental.</h4><br />
<strong>The main difference between a Pharisee and a biblical Christian is not their view on rules and application, it is their view of their own sin.</strong> The Pharisees actually thought they were righteous; that they, by their keeping of some external rules, were earning favor with God.</p>
<p>How silly would it be for a cancer patient to mock and put down another cancer patient for exhibiting different symptoms? That&rsquo;s what the Pharisees did. They looked at the victims of sin around them as if they were not sinners themselves. They pointed out the specks in other people&rsquo;s eyes while being completely oblivious to the beams sticking out of their own eyes.</p>
<p>The key to <em>&ldquo;judge not, that ye be not judged&rdquo;</em> is actually to judge. It is to judge yourself first. It is to have a healthy and realistic view of your own sinfulness and to keep that in mind when you deal with others. When we find ourselves pointing haughty fingers at the sins of others, rather than humbly begging God to forgive our sins, we are being judgmental.</p>
<h4 id="whenwejudgepeoplesheartsbasedonasecondaryapplicationofscripturewearebeingjudgmental.">When we judge people&rsquo;s hearts based on a secondary application of scripture we are being judgmental.</h4><br />
Romans 14 is another one of those passages I have never heard dogmatically applied. Consider verse 4:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Who art thou that judgest another man&rsquo;s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
I have pretty high standards and base those standards on the application of biblical principles, but I also realize that other well meaning, faithful Christians may not interpret those principles the same way that I do and may come to different conclusions.</p>
<p>When the Bible is crystal clear, I think we should stand behind it with unwavering intensity. But when I become dogmatic about what the Bible only hints at, and allow that to make me divisive and judgmental, am I not judging another man&rsquo;s servant?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.&rdquo;</em> (Romans 14:19)</blockquote><br />
<em>Let&rsquo;s emphasize what scripture emphasizes.</em></p>
