<p><em>My plans for my post this week were to write about why I am very weary of online political activism. Ironically, Monday I learned that our state legislature is trying to push through <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=5170&amp;GAID=11&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;LegId=65291&amp;SessionID=84">the most aggressively progressive gay marriage bill in the country</a>, and of the consequences that bill could have for Illinois churches so I've spent the better part of the week engaged in <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/first-louie-giglio-then-chrystal-dixon-then-us/">online</a> <a href="http://jg-tc.com/news/opinion/letter-motives-go-beyond-gay-marriage/article_e42c7e7c-60f0-11e2-aff5-0019bb2963f4.html">political activism</a>. In the midst of thinking of all this, I've noticed a pattern of behavior common to proponents of both sides of issue, behavior that is very similar to the root of fundamentalism.</em></p></p>

<h1>Defining Fundamentalist Behavior</h1></p>
<p>The liberals love to denounce fundamentalists for their insinstance that all of the Bible is true. Mention scripture in an discussion with an atheist friend, and prepare for rolled eyes and scorn. What follows is what liberals are always accusing traditional Christians of doing:</p></p>
<h2>1. Start with an unquestionable premise.</h2></p>
<p>In our case, it is that the Bible is unquestionably true. We believe that anything that goes against the Bible is false and that any argument that scripture makes is automatically rock-solid just because it's scripture.</p></p>
<h2>2. Denounce and label anyone who questions the premise and refuse to hear their arguments.</h2></p>
<p>Many times if someone doesn't believe the Bible is true, we will just call them a heretic, a heathen, or a non-believer and move on. Water under the bridge.</p></p>
<h2>3. Fight to make sure those you just labeled have as little influence as possible.</h2></p>
<p>Many times, after we label those who question our unquestionable premise, we will work hard to limit their influence in society. If I, for example, find out that another pastor does not believe the Bible is true, then I am going to warn others about that Pastor and seek to influence people away from their church.</p></p>
<p>Now there can be no question that we as fundamentalist do this. At the heart of being a fundamentalist is believing something is true and above question. I, as a fundamentalist, don't apologize for this. Scripture claims truth for itself. (I know this is circular reasoning, but I'll accept that in faith.)</p></p>
<h1>How Liberals Act Like Fundamentalists.</h1></p>
<p>I want to make the point that social progressives are fundamentalists too. They have their own unquestionable premises. They refuse to hear any argument about those premises. They label those who question them and drown them in scorn, and they are trying to push their detractors out of active society.</p></p>
<p>The case I'm thinking of (although I'm sure there are others) is homosexuality. Look at how liberals act like fundamentalists:</p></p>
<h2>1. Start with an unquestionable premise.</h2></p>
<p>In their case: <em>homosexuality is natural, harmless and hereditary</em>. This is a premise that is by no means widely accepted as a fact and one that there are tons of arguments against. For example:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They say it is natural, but there is no evolutionary reason for homosexual behavior. (I'm not an evolutionist, but think about it.) Homosexuals won't reproduce, and they have been persecuted by their peers in almost every age and culture. If "survival of the fittest" is how you explain the world, then how do homosexual's justify themselves?</p></li></p>
<li>
<p>They say it is harmless, yet there are huge health risks to a homosexual lifestyle. The numbers don't lie. Homosexuals catch sexually transmitted diseases at a vastly disproportionate rate to heterosexuals. The Center for Disease Control even has their own politically correct moniker for homosexuals. (It's "MSM" look it up.)</p></li></p>
<li>
<p>They say it is hereditary, yet people stop being homosexuals all of the time. Homosexuality is a behavior, maybe an innate desire, but "hereditary?"</p></li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Yet these are arguments that will not be heard by progressives. They refuse to have a civil and logical conversation about it. It is one area that is above logic, above science, and above pragmatic consideration.</p></p>
<p>So what do they do?</p></p>
<h2>2. Denounce and label anyone who questions their premise.</h2></p>
<p>If I were to write the above comments as a letter to the editor, I guarantee you that I would almost immediately get a chain of nasty comments. I would be called a hater, a fear monger and a bigot. I would be denounced as forcefully as their words would allow. No logic. No civility. I've questioned the unquestionable premise and so I'm not worthy of that. (I know this from experience.)</p></p>
<p>So they will:</p></p>
<h2>3. Fight to make sure those they've just labeled have as little influence as possible.</h2></p>
<p>After you have labelled the hater, there is nothing more to do than to push him out of public society. The family research council is a hate group because they deny that homosexuals were born that way. Chick-Fil-A isn't welcome in Chicago or Boston because they support the Family Research Council and their owner has the audacity to say "I'm for traditional marriage." Louie Giglio isn't worthy to pray at Obama's inauguration because he preached that homosexuality is a sin 15 years ago. Traditional groups like Catholic Charities aren't fit to handle foster care because they refuse to put children in homosexual homes.</p></p>
<h1>Takeaways:</h1></p>
<h2>1. We need to realize that this isn't a question of hate, but of conflicting world views.</h2></p>
<p>To the Christian's eye, it may seem like homosexuals hate traditional Christians. To the homosexual and their supporters, it may seem like traditional Christians hate homosexuals. Neither is necessarily true. What is true is that both traditional christians and progressive americans have faith in something and that faith forms their view of the world. It is protection of ones religion or worldview that motivates both groups, not necessarily hate.</p></p>
<h2>2. We need to realize that this conflict isn't going anywhere.</h2></p>
<p>America isn't divided right now between red states and blue states, it is divided between predominantly rural states (where the majority hold traditional world views) and predominantly urban states (where the majority tend to be atheistic/progressive.) The central conflict of our time isn't a conflict between republicans and democrats but between two very different world views.</p></p>
<p>Contrary to what progressives would have us believe, traditional religion isn't going away or even on a decline. There are far more adherents to traditional religion around the world than there are atheists or hard line progressives. Even in very secular and progressive countries (like <a href="http://illinoisfamily.org/homosexuality/massive-rally-in-france-against-same-sex-marriage-draws-at-least-340000/">France</a>) there is a large and active minority of people who still hold to traditional religion and values. Many of the problems of our world today revolve around how these two groups get along.</p></p>
<h2>3. Both parties need to determine that their view of truth does not give them the right to hostility against people.</h2></p>
<p>Many Christians look at scriptures, see that they say homosexual behavior is an abomination to God, and use that knowledge as carte blanche to say all manner of hateful things against homosexuals. (I.E. Westboro Baptist Church) Many progressives look at their dogma of homosexuals being "born that way" and see us denying that and use that as carte blanche to call us haters, bigots and fear mongers.</p></p>
<p>While we can't make those with other world views go away, we can determine that we aren't going to let truth justify hateful hostility. Christians should check their rhetoric for self-righteousness and see their ideological counterparts as people Christ died to save. Progressives need to realize that ultimately they aren't going to win if they alienate and marginalize two thirds of the world's population.</p></p>
<p>At the risk of sounding soft, we both need to realize that there are <strong>people</strong> on the other side of the ideological battlefield and that those people are worth more than targets. In other words, as we enter the battle of ideas let's aim to defeat <strong>ideas</strong>, <em>not the people who espouse them</em>.</p></p>
