<p>I am by no means a &ldquo;greek geek.&rdquo; I took two years of Greek in college. I&rsquo;ve referenced it from time to time when I come to a difficult verse, but I&rsquo;m not doing my daily devotions from my worn out Textus Receptus. Sorry.</p>

<p>Greek has a lot of complex of Greek declensions and endings that are very hard to remember if you are not in it every day. One of the obstacles to doing Greek translation work is that there really aren&rsquo;t a lot of books that help with that. If you want to get to a chart, you&rsquo;ve got to dig through a thick, old Greek textbook that often seems randomly arranged. (And who has time for that?)</p>
<p>Enter <em>The Handy Guide to New Testament Greek!</em> This is a book I wish I had a copy of back in those Greek class days, and its a book that&rsquo;s going to have a permanent place on my bookshelf next to Thayer&rsquo;s Lexicon and my Greek New Testament. It is the most visually pleasing, well organized, down to earth and human readable reference book I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>If you are (like me) a semi-literate dabbler in biblical languages, a hard core &ldquo;greek geek&rdquo; or a would be student of biblical Greek, I highly recommend you buy a copy.</p>
<p><em>I received a free review copy of this book from Kregel Publications. I was not required to give a positive review.</em></p>
