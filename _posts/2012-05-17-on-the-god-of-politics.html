<p>When I was fifteen, I was working part time for a political campaign. I have read dozens of political books (many of them deep theory books) and have listened to thousands of hours of talk radio. I have hung yard signs (and taken some down), written letters to the editor, done exit polls, called countless people for political candidatess and worked parades, fairs and fund raisers all for the political cause. I say all that to say this: I've gone deeper down that road than most people and have come to the conclusion that for a serious Christian, politics can be a huge distraction.</p>
<p>That isn't to say that a Christian shouldn't vote or do his part as a good citizen. Evil triumphs when good men do nothing. But I am absolutely convinced that the constant barage of contentious talk radio shows, doomsday news broadcasts, and muckraking political books have an adverse effect on modern christianity.</p>
<p>Christians need to be politically <em>involved</em>, but never politically <em>absorbed</em>. Unfortunately, politics has become the god of many, many, well meaning Christians.</p>
<p>Here are two things to keep in mind this political season:</p>
<h3>1. Christians are first and foremost citizens of Heaven.</h3><br />
The old song says "This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through". That may be cute, but it is also biblical. Philippians 3:20 says <em>"Our conversation is in heaven"</em>. That word "conversation" is the Greek word "polituma" from which we get our word "politics", and it refers to citizenship. God's Word also calls us <em>"strangers"</em> and <em>"pilgrims"</em>.</p>
<p>While we need to do our part as citizens of our country, that citizenship should always be secondary to our citizenship in Heaven. Our loyalties should first and foremost go to our Lord and our eternal King. Like Christ, we should <em>"be about our Father's business."</em></p>
<h3>2. The best thing a politician can do is make the world a better place to go to Hell from.</h3><br />
If God's word is true, millions of people are heading towards eternal damnation unless they hear and accept the gospel. The best thing a politician can do for those people is make their ride down a little more comfortable. Christians, however, have the ministry of reconciliation and get to be ambassadors for Christ.</p>
<p>One day, I was working in a campaign office across from a Christian man who had served as the long time mayor of New Hampshire's biggest city. Without prompting, he put his arm on my shoulder and told me I could do far more good by investing my life in the ministry than I ever could by spending my life in politics.</p>
<p>That's not to say Christians should never be politicians. We might not have the Bill of Rights in this country had it not been for the political involvement of the Baptist preacher Roger Williams. Slavery would probably never have come to an end without the crusading efforts of the devout Christian William Wilberforce.</p>
<p>God sometimes directs his servants into political involvement, but we must remember that God's work is in the winning of souls, not the winning of elections.</p>
