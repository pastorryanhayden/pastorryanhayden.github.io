<p>Being called to the ministry is a scary thing. &nbsp;When I graduated from Bible College, I knew that God wanted me to be a pastor. &nbsp;In my mind though, connecting the dots from where I was right out of college to being the pastor of the church was like trying to build a bridge across the pacific ocean, I just didn't see how it was going to happen. &nbsp;For good reason, very few churches are looking for 22 year old pastors, yet most Bible college graduates are 22 years old and chomping at the bit. &nbsp;I liken feeling called to the pastorate as a young man to when you first started being interested in girls when you were twelve: there is so much desire welling up in you and seemingly no outlet to for it. &nbsp;It is like being shot out of a cannon into a brick wall.</p></p>
<p>The same advice that I'd would give to a twelve year old that is interested in girls is the advice I'd give a very young man wanting to be a pastor. &nbsp;God doesn't give you these desires to&nbsp;consummate&nbsp;right now, God gives you them as a wake up call to get serious about preparing for a later stage of your life. &nbsp;I am by no means an expert on pastoral ministry, I've been a pastor for all of five months, but as someone who just left that stage of preparation just a few months ago, I feel like I do have some advice to give about how to best spend it.</p></p>
<p>Take these eight tips as what they are: Not as the advice of a pastor who has arrived, but as the advice of a friend who was just where you are at and wants to help you. &nbsp;Without further ado, here are the eight&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;of advice I would give to people who feel like God wants them to be a pastor.</p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<h2>First, make absolutely sure that God has called you.</h2></p>
<p>It doesn't matter that you just spent $ 30,000 on Bible college or that you don't know what else you could do. <em>Too many people are in the ministry for the wrong reasons.</em> There are other options for someone with a bible college degree (if you are like most graduates, you may even be able to go back to school, lots of people don't get out of school till they're 26) and <em>anything is better than doing something you aren't fit for</em> for the rest of your life because you made an emotional decision at a youth conference as a teenager.</p></p>
<p>It is really important that you are sure that God has called you. When you answer the call to the ministry, you really are stepping out by faith and if God isn't working on the other end, then you are headed for a mess. When I was in college, I was so insecure, and worried about silly things: My home church pastor was stepping down and his son in law was taking over. No one in my family was in the ministry and I really didn't know where my "in" was going to come from. If you are called, God works all of that out though.</p></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Faithful is he who calleth you, who also will do it."</em> 1 Thessalonians 5:24</blockquote></p>
<h2>Second, buckle down for a long haul full of disappointments.</h2></p>
<p>You are out of college, but you are not out of the woods yet. Not hardly. Prepare to be tested. Prepare to be let down.</p></p>
<p>Whatever you think is going to happen between now and when people call you "Pastor Joe", forget it. About the only thing that you can be certain of is that you are thinking wrong.</p></p>
<p>In my case my projected path to the pastorate went something like this:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>I'll get my masters of ministry</li>
<li>I'll be a youth pastor for ten years</li>
<li>I'll take over the church when the senior pastor steps down.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>But here I am and I've never been a youth pastor. I don't have a masters degree (though I'm half finished with one in elementary education - what gives?) and I didn't take over anyone's church. I made many other plans for myself over the last six years and exactly none of them came to pass. My journey took me to my home church in New Hampshire, then small town Tennessee, then rural Illinois.</p></p>
<p>Again, if you are sure that God has called you, he is working everything out according to his plan. David's journey from anointing to kingship led him through Ziklag. Moses journey to leadership had him a fugitive and a shepherd in the middle of nowhere for forty years. Have faith that God will work it all out and don't get bitter.</p></p>
<h2>Third, find an old general and get your feet under his table.</h2></p>
<p>Far and away, the most useful thing you can do with the next few years of your time is to find some pastor who has been faithful in the long haul and respected and get around him as much as possible. Take a job, any job, be it youth pastor, elementary school teacher in the christian school, or even janitor or landscaper, if it gets you under the tutelage of a seasoned man of God.</p></p>
<p>Too many Bible college graduates seem focused on becoming a "youth pastor" right out of Bible College. I've seen a lot of guys take any youth pastor job that comes available, often for a small church or for a young, inexperienced pastor. (I'm not putting you down, I almost did it.)</p></p>

He had already been pastoring for twenty years."]<a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/84feb-pastor.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-150" title="84feb-pastor" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/02/84feb-pastor-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>[/caption]</p></p>
<p>In my experience, I got the awesome privilege of working with <a href="http://fairviewathens.org">Dr. Jack Scallions</a>. I taught school, I worked in a camp, I managed ministries and did a bunch of little stuff. Most of all though, I spent countless hours in his office talking about the ministry. Under the tutelage of someone in the ministry for forty years, I got to dip my toes in almost every area of the ministry. I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. If I had to skip Bible college to work for Dr. Scallions for four years, I wouldn't even flinch. It was that awesome.</p></p>
<p>I would say be very careful who you choose. Choose someone with <em>character</em>. Choose someone that <em>thinks</em> for themselves. Choose someone who isn't trying to <em>build his own kingdom</em>. There aren't too many pastors who meet all of those requirements, but if you can find one, do whatever it takes to work for him. Seriously, move thousands of miles and cut your income in half if that's what it takes. You'll thank me later.</p></p>
<h2>Fourth, read everything you can get your hands on.</h2></p>
<p>I read on average one to two books a week. I read the newspaper every day. I read several blogs. I can't tell you how many books I've read over the last seven years, but I can tell you I don't regret much of it.</p></p>
<p>Here are some things reading will do for you:</p></p>
<h3>Reading will inspire you to be a leader</h3></p>
<p>"Readers are leaders." You saw it on the wall in your fourth grade classroom, so it has to be true. Right?</p></p>
<p>I don't know if reading makes you a leader, but I know it inspires you to be one. Whether it is a book on leadership (like <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/0743269519/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329171091&amp;sr=8-1">The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</a></em>) a book by leaders (like <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Winning-Jack-Welch/dp/0060753943/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329171117&amp;sr=1-1">Winning</a></em> by Jack Welch) or a good biography of a leader (like <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hershey-Milton-Hersheys-Extraordinary-Utopian/dp/074326410X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329171136&amp;sr=1-1">Hershey</a></em>) reading about leadership makes you want to be a leader. It broadens your horizons and makes you dissatisfied with the status quo.</p></p>
<p>One of the books I read that inspired me as much as anything was <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Like-Walt-Capturing/dp/0757302319/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329171162&amp;sr=1-1">How to Be Like Walt</a></em> a biography/leadership book about Walt Disney. I thought it would be entertaining, but it was the kind of thing where I'd stop several dozen times and write notes and ideas of things I thought God wanted me to accomplish. It was a startling reminder to me that one person devoted to a cause can accomplish so much and that is a regular inspiration to me.</p></p>
<h3>Reading will give you the intellectual capitol to think for yourself.</h3></p>
<p>I love the phrase <strong>"Intellectual Capitol"</strong>. Just as a businessman needs money (capitol) to invest and thus do business the currency of thought is information.</p></p>
<p>The Bible says that we are to <em>"study to give an answer"</em>. You'll never be able to speak intelligently about different things if you don't spend a lot of time reading nonfiction.</p></p>
<h3>Reading will fill your mind with stories.</h3></p>
<p>I'll never forget the first time I heard Scott Pauley use the illustration about Steve Jobs asking John Skully "Do you want to spend the rest of your life making sugar water or do you want to change the world." This is a perfect example of how reading can give you good illustration content for your preaching.</p></p>
<p>Now I don't preach stories, I preach the word. Sometimes though, a relevant story is like some salt and pepper in a Biblical message and helps keep peoples interest and make the message more palatable. You won't get these stories if you aren't reading.</p></p>
<h3>Reading will help you write.</h3></p>
<p>As a pastor I write at least three 3,000 word sermon manuscripts every week. I write a pastor's pen/church blog every week and a personal blog at least once a week. If you are a pastor, you're going to be writing.</p></p>
<p>Reading a lot from talented authors will improve your writing style and it will give you a high standard to measure your own writing against.</p></p>
<h3>Reading will keep you striving for the mastery.</h3></p>
<p>Nothing is worse than a man in the ministry who has "arrived" and doesn't feel the need to study, grow and learn new things. People who read are rarely these kinds of people. If you are reading for a sermon, you might fall into a plateau (you probably also only studied for an A in school), if you are reading for yourself, you are probably the kind of person who is striving for the mastery and God will bless you for it.</p></p>
<h3>Reading will strengthen your faith.</h3></p>
<p>Certain books, like the life of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/John-Newton-Disgrace-Amazing-Grace/dp/1581348487/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329171240&amp;sr=1-1">John Newton</a> or the life of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-George-Muller-MULLER-GEORGE/dp/0883681595/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329171262&amp;sr=1-3">George Muller</a> always come to mind when I am going through a hard time. Reading the stories of how God saved and led men in different situations in time past will inevitably strengthen your faith in God for your own life.</p></p>
<h2>Fifth, learn some skills that you wouldn't learn in Bible college.</h2></p>
<p>Nowadays, being a pastor who knows how to use a computer, build a shed, run electric wiring and lay out an attractive bulletin are a plus. If you use the time between graduation and when you become a pastor to learn some skills that will help you, you'll be blessed for it.</p></p>
<p>Let me recommend some:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>graphic design</li>
<li>computer repair and networking</li>
<li>anything construction related</li>
<li>music (play the piano, etc.)</li>
<li>videography</li>
<li>photography</li>
<li>sound engineering.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The list could go on and on. Learning these things will also give you some "hobbies" that will help you keep your sanity and balance you out a little.</p></p>
<h2>Sixth, work on people skills.</h2></p>
<p><strong>People don't support your ministry, people are your ministry</strong>. I confess, I have to work on my "people skills". Call it ADHD, call it being a cerebral person, or call it rudeness; whatever you call it, I live in my own world and have a hard time coming across as a caring person.</p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/100_0197.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-151" title="100_0197" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/02/100_0197-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p></p>
<p><em>A lot of people skills is perception:</em> standing up straight and tall and smiling will go a long way in helping you seem to be a people person.&nbsp;The easiest way to be a people person, though, is to genuinely care about people and work on cultivating relationships. If you really care about people, over time it will be obvious.</p></p>
<p>Few things are worse than a pastor with no people skills. When a leader doesn't care for his people and can't spend time with them, it puts everyone on edge and causes a lot of unnecessary self-doubt.</p></p>
<p>I recommend you get a mentor who will help you with this. Pastor Scallions told me things all the time like "you look dejected today" and "stand up straight". You can't imagine how helpful that is.</p></p>
<p>Also, it wouldn't hurt to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/1439167346/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329171346&amp;sr=1-1"><em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em>.</a> It's a little bit old fashioned, but there is a lot of wisdom in there.</p></p>
<h2>Seven, practice.</h2></p>
<p>In Malcolm Gladwell's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329171365&amp;sr=1-1">Outliers</a> he makes a pretty compelling case for what he calls "the ten-thousand hour rule" which simply states that if you are going to be an expert in any field you need to spend 10,000 hours practicing. 10,000 hours is a long time (I'm no where near that mark myself).</p></p>
<p>If you want to be a pastor, get serious about preparing for it. I'm sorry but your Bible College education is woefully insufficient. Take the next few years as an opportunity to dig a deeper well of Bible&nbsp;knowledge, homiletic technique, and teaching ability. You need to <strong>work on it</strong> as much as you possibly can now, because when you become a pastor, you'll spend almost all of your time <strong>working in it</strong>.</p></p>
<p>Use this time wisely and you'll appreciate it for the rest of your life.</p></p>
<h2>Finally, walk with God.</h2></p>
<p>This probably should have been the first piece of advice, because it is certainly the most important. You will never be a good spiritual leader if you aren't following God yourself. Get in the word, develop a prayer life, and get close to the Lord.</p></p>
<p>I hope this is helpful: these are the things I am most glad I did during the last seven years.</p></p>
