<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>After song lengthy twitter conversations about this article, I think I may have been a bit harsh. &nbsp;The root of the problem, in my opinion, is that "standards" is a term with no good definition. &nbsp; It means different things to different people. &nbsp;Some people, like myself, have had terrible experience with the term being twisted and overemphasized. &nbsp;I honestly have a hard time not overreacting anytime someone uses it in a Christian context, and I know that's a problem.</p>
<p>I did that to a pastor on twitter, and misunderstood and consequently misrepresented his quote, which appears below (soul winning and standards.)</p>
<p>What I'll stand by is that the Christian life was not intended to be lived by an extra-biblical rulebook, and that judging people based on moralism is a poor substitute for Bible preaching.</p>
<p>I'll be taking this post down and revising it for possible repost later.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>You say we need more standards. What do you mean by &ldquo;standards&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The dictionary defines standards as:</p>
<blockquote><p>1) a level of quality or attainment, 2) an idea or thing used as a measure, norm, or model in comparative evaluations, 3) an object that is supported in an upright position, 4) a tune or song of established popularity.</blockquote><br />
I know you aren&rsquo;t talking about us needing more popular music. I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;re not talking about flags or signs. Based on context, I don&rsquo;t think you are talking about levels of quality or attainment.</p>
<p>So you must mean we need more ideas to judge others with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back to that.</p>
<p>The standard definition that I get from other Christians for&nbsp;"standards" is: they&nbsp;are just personal or institutional rules for applying the principles of scripture to your own life.</p>
<p>Let me be clear. <em><strong>Every faithful Bible believing Christian believes in applying the Bible.</strong></em> Every faithful Bible believing Christian wants the Word to be a lamp to their feet and a light to their path. They use God&rsquo;s word to direct their life and their decisions. They try to apply God&rsquo;s word in their family life and in their leadership. Absolutely no one who loves God and His word is going to contest that.</p>
<p>Yet, usually, when someone says &ldquo;we need more standards,&rdquo; or &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t have any standards&rdquo; they are referring to a Bible believing Christian, who, by their own admission is trying to live a biblical Christian life to the glory of God. We just don&rsquo;t care for the way they are applying scripture to their own life or institution.</p>
<p>So &ldquo;standards&rdquo; means a norm used for judging. Because we are talking about specific applications of scripture that go beyond what it actually says, standards means <strong>your</strong> norm used for judging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Standards&rdquo; for many, has become an all important concept of the Christian life. The word pops up in their preaching like the dandelions in my front lawn. It&rsquo;s all over the place. Some even go so far as saying a Christians two responsibilities are to evangelize and have standards.</p>
<p>I have a real problem with that, and you should too. Standards are terrible emphasis. I can prove it five ways:</p>
<h2>1) Standards is not a biblical word or concept.</h2><br />
The word standard or standards is found a very few times in scripture, but every time it is used, it is almost always talking about some kind of flag. The word standards, as it is currently used by preachers, is completely absent from scripture.</p>
<p>But that may be semantics. Maybe language has changed and standards has become a replacement word for some other obvious biblical concept. I&rsquo;ve looked for a long time, and its just not there. There is no passage of scripture that teaches the importance of having standards.</p>
<p>Now, there are passages of scriptures with rules for Christians. There are passages that should govern how we dress and govern our entertainment, music, etc.. But there are no passages on the concept of standards. None.</p>
<p>If it bothers you that I&rsquo;m writing this, go look for yourself. Show me the passage of scripture that is all about how important it is for a Christian to have standards and I&rsquo;ll delete this post and publish a retraction.</p>
<h2>2) The concept of standards is not historically significant.</h2><br />
One of the marvels of the modern age is that so much of the great preaching of history is online and searchable. If you know what you are doing, you can search through a ton of great preaching from the past. I&rsquo;ve searched and searched for sermons on standards from before the 1950s and found them completely absent.</p>
<p>Charles Spurgeon was certainly a man who believed in applying the scripture. He refused to have a piano in his church because he saw it as a bar instrument. He took a strong stand against theatre attendance (before there were movies). He also preached thousands of sermons that have all been transcribed and put on the internet. Guess what, he never once preached on the topic of standards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a ton of F.B. Meyer, G. Campbell Morgan, R.A. Torrey, A.W. Tozer, D. Martyn Lloyd Jones and several other preachers who lived and preached before the middle of the 1900s and have never seen a single reference to standards in any of their works or preaching.</p>
<p>So here we have a major emphasis of modern preaching that both the Bible and the preachers of history are totally mute on. Before I go any farther, I think that&rsquo;s a problem. Even if there were nothing else to say on the subject, you&rsquo;ve got to admit that&rsquo;s pretty tenuous ground to be standing on.</p>
<p>But there is more to say on the subject.</p>
<h2>3) The one group in scripture obsessed with standards were Jesus&rsquo; biggest enemies.</h2><br />
The name &ldquo;Pharisee&rdquo; meant &ldquo;the seperated ones.&rdquo; They were a group that arose, probably during the time of Ezra, that made a conscious decision that God&rsquo;s law was going to be their law. They were dead serious about this. During the time of the Maccabaean revolt, many Pharisees fought a war or chose execution rather than break God&rsquo;s laws.</p>
<p>There were two problems with this: First, over time, the Pharisees became so obsessed with the external aspects of God&rsquo;s law, that they totally missed the main points of God&rsquo;s law. What God really wanted and said got drowned in a sea of man-made legislation. Second, the Pharisees actually took the application of some of these laws farther than God intended for them to. They became stricter than God, and the entire jewish society suffered for it.</p>
<p>When you read the gospels, especially the gospel of Matthew, you see this come up again and again. The standards of the Pharisees, their applications of scripture for judging others and protecting their own righteousness, became one of the main points of contention between Jesus and these religious rulers. Much of the teaching of Jesus was combatting this and replacing it with the truth.</p>
<p>So I actually don&rsquo;t believe that the New Testament says NOTHING about standards. I actually think the New Testament has a lot to say about standards, I think it&rsquo;s one of the main themes of Matthew. I just don&rsquo;t think the New Testament has anything POSITIVE to say about standards.</p>
<h2>4) Standards always replace God&rsquo;s most heart searching commands.</h2><br />
We see, in the Pharisees, the main danger of emphasizing standards. When you try to turn scriptural principles into a bunch of rules, inevitably, you will emphasize externals. The Old Testament, for the Pharisees, became all about things they could measure, like sabbath observance, the size of their phylacteries, and the amount of proselytes they could get in the synagogue door. (Read Matthew 23 carefully.)</p>
<p>They totally missed the whole &ldquo;love God with all your heart soul and mind and love thy neighbor as thyself.&rdquo; bit. They were clueless about the themes of the gospel. But boy did they have standards.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what inevitably&nbsp;happens when you emphasize turning scripture into rules. It&rsquo;s way easier to follow a list of man-made rules based on the scripture than it is to allow God to rule your heart. Rules are a lot simpler than righteousness.</p>
<p>Standards, then, become a replacement for what God&rsquo;s word actually does say.</p>
<h2>5) We are actually commanded not to judge other&rsquo;s obedience.</h2><br />
When I started I made the case that standards an rules for judging the obedience of others. That&rsquo;s actually something scripture teaches us NOT to do.</p>
<p>We see this in the context of the Pharisees in Matthew 7:1-5</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged:and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
I&rsquo;ve never heard a preacher who emphasizes standards to anything but explain this passage away. But what does it mean if it doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t be judging the obedience of other Christians.</p>
<p>Romans 14 teaches this to. Think about verse 4.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up:for God is able to make him stand.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
It&rsquo;s not our job to look at other Christians and judge how they are doing at applying God&rsquo;s principles to their life. That&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s job. It&rsquo;s our job to obey God personally.</p>
<p>So if standards to you just means applying God&rsquo;s word. That&rsquo;s great, so long as you keep it to yourself and not use it as a measuring stick for others. When you start judging the pastor across town by the length of his wife&rsquo;s cullottes, it&rsquo;s you who is ignoring some pretty clear commands of scripture.</p>
<hr />
<p>So standards is not a concept emphasized in the Bible, it&rsquo;s not a concept that is historically significant, and the only thing the Bible says about it is negative.</p>
<p>Can we just get back to preaching what God actually does say and trying to win the world for Christ.</p>
<p><em>As always, if you think I'm way off, and can disprove the things I've said with Bible, history and logic, have at it in the comments.</em></p>
