<p>In No He Can't, Kevin McCullough, like hundreds of other authors tells us everything that is wrong with the Obama administration and predicts how Barack Obama is going to cause the end of the world (or at least America as we know it.) McCullough, a syndicated talk show host, was one of the first people to come on record and predict that Obama would be the next president (while a talk show host in Chicago) and has a local's insight into Obama's history (or lack of history.)</p>
<p>I really wanted to like this book. I'm far from a liberal and not an Obama supporter. I do think that Obama might be doing irrepairable harm to our country and I do think that there is a certain shady mystery to his past. When I got this book, it was as the election season was starting to pick up and I wanted to be informed about President Obama. I wanted to like the book, but it really was a let down for me.<br />
That's not to say I found the book lacking in facts. It abounds with information about Obama's presidency. Nor was it written poorly, I found it well written and easy to follow. It just lacked *something*.<br />
Most likely, that something has a lot more to do with my personal opinion and make up (and total loathing of political noise) than it does the actual content of the book. Which is why I've been hesitent to write a review.<br />
Would I reccommend the book to others? If you came to me and asked for a source of information about President Obama's early time as president, I'd tell you to go buy this book. If you, like me, have long ago made up your mind that the President's policies are bad for our country or if you are looking for a book laying out political ideals, I would reccomend something else.</p>
