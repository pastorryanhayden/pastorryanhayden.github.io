<h1>Levels of Biblical Authority</h1><br />
I&rsquo;m currently working on a homiletics curriculum for lay preachers and sunday school teachers. As a part of that, I&rsquo;ve been going back through some of my favorite books on preaching and rereading them. Today, in Wayne McGill&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/12-Essential-Skills-Great-Preaching/dp/0805432973/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435087503&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=12+essential+skills+for+great+preaching&amp;pebp=1435087505660&amp;perid=0PKPET23Q9JR0ZS5JQ97">12 Essential Skills for&nbsp;Great Preaching </a>- I was reintroduced to the concept of levels of biblical authority. McGill gives four levels and defines only two - but I thought I would expand on them and give six:</p>
<h2>1. Direct Biblical Authority</h2><br />
A sermon can be said to have direct biblical authority when the main idea of the sermon is the main idea of the text from which it is derived.</p>
<h2>2. Indirect Biblical Authority</h2><br />
A sermon can be said to have indirect biblical authority when the main idea of the sermon is a secondary idea of the text from which it is derived.</p>
<h2>3. Casual Biblical Authority</h2><br />
A sermon can be said to have a casual biblical authority when the main idea or ideas of the sermon are based loosely on a biblical theme derived from all of scripture.</p>
<h2>4. Corrupted Biblical Authority</h2><br />
A sermon can be said to have corrupted biblical authority when the main idea of the sermon is based on a misinterpretation of the text from which it is derived.</p>
<h2>5. Replaced Biblical Authority</h2><br />
When no attempt is made to connect the sermon to the Bible - the authority of the sermon doesn&rsquo;t come from scripture - but from the personality or position of the speaker.</p>
<h2>6. Fuzzy Biblical Authority</h2><br />
The sermon has no discernible point and thus cannot be tied to the scripture or even a personality or position.</p>
<h1>Takeaways</h1><br />
I think this helps us to remember several things about our preaching:</p>
<ul>
<li>The authority of good preaching is derived from the Bible.</li>
<li>The further you get from the Bible, the less authoritative your message becomes.</li>
<li>The further away you get from (#1) direct biblical authority, the more <strong>subjective</strong> your sermon becomes and the greater your chances of making an anti-biblical point.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, we hear (and even read in sermon periodicals) way too much 3-6 preaching.</li>
<li>If we aren&rsquo;t clear about what our point is, the people who hear us won&rsquo;t be either and our sermon will have no authority.</li><br />
</ul><br />
