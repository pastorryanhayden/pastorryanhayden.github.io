<p>This Saturday, I had a good conversation with a couple of young pastors about mentorship in independent Baptist churches. While I'm sure that independent Baptists as a whole could do much better in the mentorship department, personally, I had a wonderful experience being mentored by an older pastor and regularly advise young people to seek out a similar experience. For a period of almost five years, I got to spend a couple hours a week in the office of a man who had pastored for over forty years, and to ask him questions and glean from his wisdom about the ministry.</p>
<p>I'm fortunate that my pastor had a heart for young people and didn't have an attitude about my generation. He told me at times where he saw flaws in my generation, but he was also honest about the struggles we face that weren't present for earlier generations.</p>
<p>In a sense, young pastors today have it easy. Study tools have never been easier to use. There has never been more sermons available for us to glean from or easier access to books. Even with our current recession, the standard of living today greatly exceeds the average standard of living thirty years ago.</p>
<p>In another sense, some of the same things that make our life easier also make it more complicated.</p>
<p><em>I want to take the rest of this post and list three reasons why it's harder, or at least more complicated, being a thirty year old pastor in 2014 than it was being a thirty year old pastor in 1984.</em></p>
<h2>1. Reason #1: The internet.</h2><br />
The internet is the great information equalizer and a great leveler. Poor people in Bangladesh can audit online classes from Harvard University for free. As the journalist Thomas Friedman wrote 7 years ago "The World Is Flat" now. (If you don't know what I'm talking about, google it, it's a fascinating book.)</p>
<p>An important consequence of this new flatness for pastors is this: Not only can anybody access just about any information easily, but anybody can publish any information just as easily. Let's face it, if I wanted to write these kinds of things twenty years ago, I'd have to find a bunch of addresses, invest in expensive printing equipment, go through the process of printing these ideas out, and then pay expensive postage. If I wanted to listen to you preach, I'd have to mail you a check and you'd have to mail me a cassette tape. It was waaayyy harder to publish your opinions.</p>
<p>So how does that make our life more complicated? Anybody with an axe to grind against any pastor can publish any thing. If an independent Baptist pastor has an affair or does something criminal - the whole world knows about it the next day. If some guy carries on like an idiot for forty minutes in the pulpit on Sunday, the masses of haters can make fun of it and pass it around the world on Monday via social media.</p>
<p>You just can't hide stuff anymore. Scandals that have been hushed and hidden for thirty years are now in the full light of day. You could admire and follow somebody in 1984 who had a dark racist streak or who did questionable things with church money because you probably didn't hear about it - today, that would be impossible.</p>
<p>(By the way, I'm not in any way insisting that we SHOULD have hidden stuff in the first place, I'm just saying that in our day, young pastors aren't just having to deal with the scandals of today, but scandals that got swept under the rug thirty or sixty years ago by men older generations put on a pedestal.)</p>
<p>So the internet forces a kind of face the facts accountability that is historically a new thing. It makes things a bit more complicated for young independent Baptist pastors.</p>
<h2>2. Reason #2: Southern Baptists and Other Evangelicals.</h2><br />
I've read a lot of books about the fundamentalist-modernist battles of the 1900's as well as books about the emergence of fundamentalism and the independent Baptist movement. From my standpoint, as someone who didn't live then but has read about it, it seems that it was a lot easier to take a strong stand against evangelicals and denominationalism twenty or thirty years ago.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I mean.</p>
<p>If you were to study the history of the Southern Baptist convention, the convention out of which most independent Baptists came, and were to look at it in the mid to late 1900s, you'd find that it was really messed up. There were SBC colleges overrun by full blown Bible denying liberals. Their seminaries were hostile to conservative and traditional Christianity. Their missions sending agencies were corrupt. There was a huge group of theologically liberal churches in the convention and the leadership of the convention was going back and forth in a constant and seemingly fruitless battle. That's not the observations of an SBC hater, that the summation you'd get from current SBC leaders.</p>
<p>So if you were to rail against the SBC and warn against liberalism in the SBC twenty years ago - you'd have a strong case to stand on.</p>
<p>What about today?</p>
<p>Today the SBC is led by militantly conservative (in the theological sense) guys. The theological liberals have been pushed out of the schools, the seminaries and the leadership and the convention actually is vigilant against theological nonsense in the pulpits.</p>
<p>That's not to say the SBC doesn't have it's problems: Nominalism, the church growth movement, unbridled CCM, hyper-calvinism are a few that come to mind. But many of today's leaders of the SBC are people I can imagine being asked to speak at Tennessee Temple thirty or forty years ago.</p>
<p>A lot of evangelicals are acting like moderate fundamentalists (and vice versa.)</p>
<p>Why does this make it more complicated to be a young IFB pastor? Let's face it, it's just not black and white anymore. You take a hard IFB party line stance and to an outsider, you are going to seem like a total jerk.</p>
<p>Now that's just the SBC, when you throw in groups like the Confessional Presbyterians and Bible church groups like the IFCA that never touched liberalism with a ten foot pole, groups that the internet makes it harder to pretend like they aren't there, it makes our job of explaining why we are independent Baptists a little more difficult.</p>
<h2>3. Reason # 3: Popular Culture.</h2><br />
I realize that popular culture had never been a fan of biblical Christianity, but you cannot mistake that popular culture has become militantly anti-Christian in the last decade. Consider this, fifty years ago, the lead actor on America's most popular sitcom (Dick Van Dyke) was a lay preacher in a Presbyterian church (Not a very strong one, but still). Just stating in a public forum that you believe that homosexuality is a sin or that you believe in creation is enough to ostracize you from public society in many places. The heat is being turned up against Bible believing Christians in america.</p>
<p>People don't go to church anymore. They don't listen to preachers (or anyone) at their door step. Pastors are not respected in society.</p>
<p>These might be necessary things for purifying the church, but you cannot deny that they make it a little more complicated to be a pastor in 2014.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><br />
I respect the fire out of older preachers. I wouldn't be where I am today if they weren't where they were thirty years ago. Several of them have poured their life into me and I'm a better Christian, father and pastor because of it.</p>
<p>But, the landscape has changed a lot in the last thirty years - it's changed a lot in the last ten years it made it a lot more complicated to be a young pastor. My one request for the older generation of independent Baptist leaders is that they recognize that, and that they give us young guys a little bit of leeway.</p>
