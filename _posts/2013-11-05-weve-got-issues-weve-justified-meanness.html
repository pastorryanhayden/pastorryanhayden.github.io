<p><em>Below is chapter three from the book I've been working on "We've Got Issues" about being an independent Baptist pastor. Here are links to the&nbsp;<a title="Help Me Finish My Book" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/help-finish-book/">introduction</a>,&nbsp;<a title="We&rsquo;ve Got Issues &ndash; We&rsquo;ve Abandoned Biblical Preaching" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wevegotissuespreaching/">chapter 1</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Issues Chapter 2: Intellectuals" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/issues-chapter-2-intellectuals/">chapter 2</a>, and <a title="We&rsquo;ve Got Issues: We Worship Successful Leaders" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/weve-got-issues-worship-successful-leaders/">chapter 3</a>.&nbsp;This is a very early version of the fourth chapter. &nbsp;The footnotes don't currently work, and it has had only minimal editing.<br />

<blockquote><p>"Certainly we are not to show our decision by that obstinate, furious, wolfish bigotry which cuts off every other body from the chance and hope of salvation and the possibility of being regenerate or even decently honest if they happen to differ from us about the color of a scale of the great leviathan." <strong>Charles Spurgeon</strong></blockquote></p>
<h1>The Ideal</h1></p>
<h2>Ideally, IFB pastors would take a strong stand for the truth of God's Word.</h2><br />
The book of Jude tells us to <em>"Earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints."</em><a href="Jude%201:3">fn</a> That is not a suggestion, but a command. As pastors, we are duty bound to defend truth and oppose error.</p>
<p>Of course we know this. In the DNA of every fundamentalist is the knowledge that the Truth is under attack and needs men of God to stand. We know the church is the <em>"pillar and the ground of the truth"</em>.<a href="1%20Timothy%203:15">fn</a> We know that truth matters.</p>
<p>But we have to go beyond that...</p>
<h2>Ideally, IFB pastors would be obedient to the Bible's commands to mark and avoid heretics.</h2><br />
<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Romans16%3A17" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Romans 16:17</a> says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them."</em></blockquote><br />
It's not enough for us to fight against error, we have to separate from it. The main between us and denominational Baptists is our willingness to separate ecclesiastically from theological error.</p>
<h2>Ideally, IFB pastors would realize that God commands us to stand for truth and combat error with a gracious, gentle spirit.</h2><br />
Ephesians says we should be <em>"speaking the truth in love."</em><a href="Ephesians%204:15">fn</a> What's that mean? I think 2 Timothy explains it well when it says we must <em>"not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient."</em><a href="2%20Timothy%202:24">fn</a> Whatever, it means to speak the truth in love, it doesn't mean looking for a fight (striving) and it is done in a spirit of gentleness. After writing about this very thing in <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/James3" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">James 3</a>, James concluded by saying <em>"the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace."</em><a href="James%203:18">fn</a> In other words, if God is in it, it's going to be done in a peaceful way.</p>
<p>Whatever God intends for us when He commands us to <em>"earnestly contend for the faith"</em> He does not intend for us to be characterized by a loveless strife that seeks the destruction of our philosophical or theological opponents. We must contend with out becoming contentious. We must stand with a Christlike spirit.</p>
<p>While it's true that Jesus sometimes had harsh words for His audience (particularly the extremely conservative Pharisees), His aim was to convert and instruct them, not to destroy them. We must also remember that Jesus had something that we do not have - He had the ability to see inside the hearts and minds of men. We can only guess at people's motivations, but Jesus had perfect knowledge of what was going on behind the surface. He was infallible, and when He spoke, He spoke the Words of God. In contrast, we are extremely fallible, and prone to misjudge people's intentions.</p>
<p>Speaking of love, Paul made it clear in <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians13" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 13</a> that a ministry without Charity is pointless, then went on to tell us how we could tell if a ministry had charity. One of the first things he said about charity was that it is kind. A ministry that cannot stay kind is nothing more than a <em>"sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal."</em> It is <em>"nothing."</em></p>
<h2>Ideally, IFB pastors would learn to rejoice whenever Christ is preached.</h2><br />
One truth that is often missed by IFB preachers is that Moses, Paul and even Christ did not act as if they had a monopoly on the truth. <a href="Philippians%201:18,">fn</a> When the truth was preached, even when it was by someone not in their crowd, their attitude was one of rejoicing.</p>
<p>I'll not spend a lot of time on this point because the next chapter is dedicated to it, but I don't believe that contending for the faith is intended to be partisan. In other words, we are not called to earnestly contend for our crowd, but to earnestly contend for the faith. Those are two things that are often confused, but are not the same thing.</p>
<h1>The Reality</h1><br />
Independent Baptists are not known as a group for their charity, kindness or fairness. Just by monitoring the online sermons and social media posts of independent Baptist pastors, it's not hard to come away thinking that, as a group, we tend to blood lust.</p>
<p>Many IFB pastors seem to think they have a God-given call to be a jerk. Whether it's spending a good percentage of their sermon "meddling" and saying things the Bible doesn't say (like railing against such biblically important things as colored dress shirts or instant mashed potatoes.) Predicting apostacy on entire generations of preachers (a recent article I read called young IFB pastors "a bunch of preppy absoloms who knew more about their palm pilot than the New Testament and couldn't write a sermon without a computer") or hurling pejoratives like "liberal" "compromiser" or "neo-evangelical" at other preachers with the surgical exactness of a two-year old playing operation. These men seem to think that God put them on the earth to stir up trouble.</p>
<p>The fighting spirit definitely has deep roots in fundamentalism. We've all seen the pictures of Billy Sunday with his dukes up. We've all heard stories of famous fundamentalist combatants. Both Fundamentalism and the IFB are movements that were birthed in controversy.</p>
<p><a class="fancybox" title="" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/billy_sunday2.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1415" alt="billy_sunday2" src="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/billy_sunday2.gif" width="360" height="254" /></a></p>
<p>Too often, that controversy went too far. Fundamentalist leaders in the 1920s and 1930s were caustic anti-communists, and even sometimes even fiercely racist. Many of the first generation of fundamentalist leaders (Frank Norris, Mordecai Ham, William Bell Riley, etc.) bought into the <em>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em> myth that taught that there was a jewish/communist conspiracy trying to take over Christian society. They went around the country preaching the gospel, but also preaching the false ideas that their political enemies were involved in a huge jewish anti-Christian conspiracy. Some of the very early IFB leaders had deep ties to the KKK. In the 1950s and 1960s, many fundamentalist leaders spent their time opposing desegregation.</p>
<p>It's not worthwhile to go through fundamentalist history and outline every mean and unchristian thing that was ever said or published by a fundamentalist leader. Suffice to say that if you read any of the histories of fundamentalism, you will find myriad examples. Earnestly contending for the faith too soon became an excuse for some to just be contentious.</p>
<p>That same contentious fighting spirit is still alive and well within fundamentalism today. It manifests itself every day on twitter, social media, and blogs. It manifests itself every time some of the major fundamentalist newspapers are put out, and unfortunately, it manifests itself too often in the pulpit. Its fruit are the towns with several IFB churches who hold almost identical positions on everything the Bible says and on almost every area of practice, but who will do nothing with each other but criticize.</p>
<h1>How Do We Fix This?</h1></p>
<h2>Flee from the spirit of strife.</h2><br />
Many of us have a natural, fleshly tendency to love strife. As Christian ministers, we need to realize that God has called us to a life above the fray. He has called us to be gentle, to be apt to teach, and to instruct those who oppose themselves in meekness. A spirit of strife excludes all of that.</p>
<h2>Realize we are after converts, not casualties.</h2><br />
Every lost person has one thing in common, they are all under the control of the same spiritual darkness that once controlled us, and they all need to be set free from the power of sin by the miraculous power of Christ. God did not call us to go into all the world and preach the gospel to white, upwardly mobile, right-leaning, family values orientated republicans living only in the red states. He called us to preach the gospel to every creature. That includes those on the other side of the social/political divide.</p>
<p>When we start seeing lost people, whether they go to church or not, as the enemy we can be sure that we are being duped by Satan. No cancer patient in remission goes to the hospital to mock the symptoms of other cancer patients, but born again Christians love to point out the sin of non- believers as evidence that they are better than them.</p>
<p>We are not trying to slay people, we are trying to bring them life. You don't go about those two things in anywhere near the same way. We need to constantly remind ourselves of that and run our communication and our "contending for the faith" through that filter.</p>
<h2>Aim to be as just and true as possible.</h2><br />
God is perfectly true and God is perfectly just. God does not broad brush. He paints both with lights and darks.</p>
<p>As fundamentalists "earnestly contending for the faith" we need to be a lot more concerned with whether what we are saying is true or is just. Is it just or true to call an evangelical pastor who is himself earnestly contending for the faith a liberal because he has come to a different conclusion on some extra-biblical issues than we have? Is it possible that his position stems from the context he was saved or raised in? Is it just to label a fellow IFB pastor a "neo" just because he uses a screen in his service?</p>
<p>Words mean something. When we apply labels to other servants of God that are not totally true or just, it shows we have given up imitating out Lord.</p>
<h2>Warn to warn, not for amens. Speak the truth in love.</h2><br />
Much of the untrue, unjust or hateful rhetoric that is thrown out in pulpits or other forms of IFB communication is not even intended for the guilty, it's just done to excite the crowd. We have a word for people who will beat up on others for the applause of men - it's the word "bully." Putting other people done to lift ourselves up is not spiritual, it is fleshly.</p>
<p>Do we really believe that when Jesus called out the Pharisees, His intention was just to excite the disciples? Certainly He may have intended to warn the multitudes, but was He trying to entertain them?</p>
<p>When we warn, let's just warn. Let's do it seriously and carefully, and let's do it with helping people as our only intention.</p>
<h2>Realize that God warns us against accepting the teaching of mean-spirited men.</h2><br />
The Bible doesn't tell us to judge preachers by apocryphal stories of full aisles or by the stands they took against alcohol, social decline, or communism. It does tell us to judge preachers by the Word of God and to judge preachers by their spirit. James chapter 3 is all about evaluating preachers, and it concludes by saying this:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. 14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. 16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. 17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace."</em></blockquote><br />
Maybe it's time we reevaluated some of our heroes and started holding preachers accountable for a caustic spirit.</p>
