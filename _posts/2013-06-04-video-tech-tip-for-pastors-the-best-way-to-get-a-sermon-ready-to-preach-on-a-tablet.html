<h2>UPDATE</h2><br />
I no longer use iA writer and have gone back to using an iPad. My workflow is the same as above, I now write in markdown, but it's been greatly simplified by the app Ullyses III, which allows me to add a Epub to iBooks from the app I write in in 2 clicks.</p>

<p></UPDATE></p>
<p>In the video above, I show preachers my method for creating sermon manuscripts and turning them into very useable kindle ebooks using free tools. &nbsp;Notes and links on the software I use are listed below:</p>
<h3>About Markdown:</h3><br />
Markdown is a plain text syntax for writers that easily converts to HTML. &nbsp;It takes minutes to learn and is&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;useful. &nbsp;To learn more about markdown, visit&nbsp;<a title="Daring Fireball - creator of Markdown" href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics</a>.</p>
