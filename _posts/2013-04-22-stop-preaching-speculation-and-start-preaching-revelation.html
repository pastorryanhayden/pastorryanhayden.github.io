<p>My very first week at Bible Baptist, I started preaching series in Matthew and Exodus. Now, a year and a half later, I'm almost finished with Exodus and I've just reached the half way point in Matthew. I don't say that to brag, I'm not trying to pass myself off as a noble expository preacher. My point is that it is probably going to take a lifetime for me to go through the New Testament, and if God really blesses, I'll make it through the Old Testament too. <strong>There is way more to cover than I have time for, and all of it is important to God.</strong></p>

<p>When I was a school teacher, I was given a curriculum at the beginning of ever school year and told it was my responsibility to teach everything in there by the end of the year. It was always overwhelming. I had the freedom to take my kids outside and skip History class on a warm spring day, but every time I did that I robbed myself of time to do what I was supposed to be doing and made my chances of achieving my goals slimmer.</p>
<p>Thats why I am very cautious about letting anything replace the regular teaching and preaching of the Word. God's given me more to cover than I have time for, what He has to say takes priority, I don't have time to mess around.</p>
<p>When I hear preachers give pulpit time to politics, to their prophecy predictions, to conspiracy theories, or to some pet doctrine that isn't concretely laid out in scripture. It kind of irks me. Like the teacher who is working hard at teaching chemistry to tenth graders when the guy next door just wants to play kickball all the time instead of class. Goof off on your own time, the pulpit is for Bible preaching.</p>
<p>But it's not just a waste of time. I have a bigger problem with it. The FDA <em>might</em> be poisoning us. Obama <em>might</em> be the anti-Christ. God <em>might</em> have intended an allegorical interpretation of Nehemiah's gates. We <em>might</em> be living under a one world government within ten years. There <em>might</em> be a numerical code to scripture. Might. Might. Might. Might. <strong>It's all speculative.</strong> I cannot say any of those things with the same <strong>certainty</strong> that I can say God doesn't want us to steal or that Christ died for the sins of the world. (or anything else He has clearly revealed in His Word.)</p>
<p>What's speculative is never certain. What's speculative is never authoritative. There is no might in might.<br />
[well]Quick Fact: Early fundamentalist leaders threw the weight of their words behind Adolf Hitler, the Democratic party, the Klu Klux Klan, the protocols of Israel (an anti-semite conspiracy theory) and the defeat of segregation. Be careful when you speculate.[/well]</p>
<p>Preaching is supposed to be <strong>certain</strong>. Preaching isn't theorizing, it is delivering the facts of God's word.</p>
<p>Preaching is supposed to be <strong>authoritative</strong>. Jesus didn't preach as the scribes, but preached <em>"as one having authority."</em> A quick survey of Peter and Paul's recorded sermons would show you that his followers followed suit.</p>
<p>Preaching can be authoritative and certain because it is a message that comes from God. When I preach, I don't want to yell people into submission, I want to show them without a shadow of a doubt that this is what God's Word says and that this is what God wants them to do. If my message is God's message, then it's not about obeying me, it's about obeying God. My authority and certainty as a preacher are entirely <strong>borrowed</strong>. The farther away I step from God's message, the less my authority as a preacher.</p>
<p>It's not our job to be smart. It's not our job to be clever. It's not our job to be powerful. We are merely heralds of a message given to us by someone else. Let's get off of the playground and get into the classroom.</p>
