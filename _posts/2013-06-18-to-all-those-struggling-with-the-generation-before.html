<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show them&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>When this thought enters your mind, if it is left unchecked, you can almost guarantee that foolishness is about to follow. It can be the root of rebellion, of jealously, and of the wrong kind of competitive spirit. It is a thought that comes with strife and envy, <em>&ldquo;and where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It seems to me that the majority of evangelical Christians in my generation have built their lives, at least in some small part, around thumbing their nose at the fundamentalists of a generation ago. They are saying <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show them&hellip;&rdquo;</em> to the hopelessly square, unreasonably strict, theologically uninformed parents and pastors who raised them.</p>
<p>And what are they showing them? What are the emblems of their spiritual superiority?</p>
<p>Beer bottles. Bathing suits. Trap sets. Tattoos. Hipster clothing. The list goes on. If my parents tried to show their spirituality with floor length culottes and a pocket full of chick tracts, those in my generation seem to be showing off their spiritual superiority with body art and an iPhone full of Taylor Swift. Both actions probably stem from self-righteousness and both of them emphasize the trivial.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-06-18-at-11.19.57-PM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1215 alignnone" alt="Screen Shot 2013-06-18 at 11.19.57 PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/Screen-Shot-2013-06-18-at-11.19.57-PM-300x163.png" width="300" height="163" /></a></p>
<p>So what should we show to that generation before us who so many want to mock and satirize?</p>
<h2 id="wecanshowthemwelovegodandhisword.">We can show them we love God and His Word.</h2><br />
Instead of showing them how much better we are and parading our Christian liberty before them, how about we show them our heart for God by trying to live in the Spirit and living in the light of God&rsquo;s Word. Why don&rsquo;t we show, through our everyday life, that our life is full of <em>love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance</em>. Why don&rsquo;t we <em>&ldquo;visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction and keep ourselves unspotted from the world.&rdquo;</em> Instead of showing the fruit of a boisterous liberty, why not just <em>&ldquo;abide in Christ&rdquo;</em> and let His fruit come through?</p>
<h2 id="wecanshowthemforgivenessandforbearance.">We can show them forgiveness and forbearance.</h2><br />
I&rsquo;m going to say something that might just blow your mind. Ready?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>In 1992 it was not 2013.</strong> 1969 was not 2008. &rsquo;85 was not &rsquo;05.</blockquote><br />
The reason I feel I have to say this is that so often, we project our understanding and our context onto a previous generation of believers.</p>
<p>If you lived through the early sixties and saw all of the social upheaval and sexual revolution from the perspective of a previous generation, you might just go to ridiculous extremes in the way you emphasized personal righteousness and separation from the world. If you were raised in the Jim Crow south, you might just grimace at the thought of inter-racial marriage. If you went to Bible college in the 1970s, 1980s or even much of the 1990s, you probably were not taught about expository preaching.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say all of that to make excuses for unbiblical ideas and methods of ministry. I&rsquo;m saying that we need to try to understand previous generations in the context of their times, and that it is wrong for us to assume that they had all of the same knowledge or influences that we have. If we were them, and had their background, we very well may have done the same things.</p>
<p>So forgive and forbear. Give people time. Get over the proud assumption that you don&rsquo;t have any faults that you are blind to.</p>
<h2 id="wecanshowthemthegratitude.">We can show them the gratitude.</h2><br />
I may not agree with everything that was emphasized in my Christian school. I may not preach in the same way my pastor preached when I was 14. I may have hated the rules in my Christian college. I may have had much to struggle through.</p>
<p>But I was surrounded by adults who genuinely loved me, who loved God and wanted to do His will, and who poured their lives into mine. My Christian school teachers gave me a better-than-average foundational understanding of the Bible and an adequate high school education. My pastor loved me enough to help me navigate through some of the most difficult times in my life. The crazy rules at college helped instill discipline and a love for order.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that they were far from perfect (just as I am today) I&rsquo;m grateful that I was raised in a conservative, fundamentalist environment.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><br />
So next time your tempted to thumb your nose up at those stodgy, older, stricter Christians - the next time you think &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you&hellip;&rdquo; why not show them the fruits of a relationship with God? Why not show them the kind of patience they showed you throughout your childhood? Why not show them a little gratitude?</p>
<p>Or you could continue to go the more spiritual route and show them another tattoo.</p>
