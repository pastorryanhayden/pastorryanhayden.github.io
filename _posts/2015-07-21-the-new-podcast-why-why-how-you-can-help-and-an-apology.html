<h2>What is TFOP?</h2><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/podcast-iPhone-6.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-2218 alignleft" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/podcast-iPhone-6-147x300.png" alt="podcast - iPhone 6" width="147" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>In case you missed it - I&rsquo;ve started a podcast. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.thefoolishnessofpreaching.com/">The Foolishness of Preaching Podcast</a> (TFOP from now on) and it&rsquo;s all about preaching. Each week, I interview a pastor, evangelist, missionary or homilitics teacher about preaching with the goal of providing all of us an education at how to be a better preacher. <a href="http://www.thefoolishnessofpreaching.com/">Check it out here</a>:</p>
<p>TFOP is different from my blog in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s not controversial</strong>. If you want to hear me grill people, you won&rsquo;t hear it on TFOP. TFOP is purposely positive. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I agree with every guest and it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the guests agree with each other. I&rsquo;m not viewing this as a way to get my opinion out there, but as a way to get exposed to the philosophy and preaching practices of a diverse group of preachers. I think you&rsquo;ll find there is a value in that.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s not about me or my views.</strong> In each episode, I interview people and it&rsquo;s my goal to make the guest and not myself the center of conversation. Obviously, this blog is ALL my ideas - so the podcast will be different.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s focused.</strong> The focus of TFOP is preaching. Besides some brief comments each episode about the guest - we&rsquo;ll try to stay on that topic.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s scheduled.</strong> I don&rsquo;t blog regularly. I will be releasing a podcast episode every saturday.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<h1>Why am I doing this?</h1><br />
My main goal in doing this is to <strong>promote good preaching</strong>. We&rsquo;ve been called to &ldquo;preach the word&rdquo; and to &ldquo;feed the flock of God.&rdquo; I want to spur people to Bible preaching, teach people how to do it better and to encourage those doing it now.</p>
<p><strong>I want to provide an entertaining resource for pastors to learn to do their main job - preaching</strong> - better. Something you can listen to while you are working in your woodshop or mopping the floor or driving down the road that is not just entertaining, but will help you be a better preacher.</p>
<p>A third goal I have is to<strong> introduce and promote people who you may not have heard of but who have been faithfully preaching</strong> or are faithfully preaching in some far off place somewhere. Most of the guests on this show will not be preaching celebrities - they&rsquo;ll be regular guys you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of but are nonetheless faithfully doing the job God&rsquo;s given them. I think each one of those guys have something to teach us and it&rsquo;s my goal to get some of that in each episode.</p>

Right now, I&rsquo;m taking the church sound board, unplugging everything and bringing it into my office to record episodes. The sound guys aren&rsquo;t happy and it&rsquo;s not helping me improve my sound quality. I&rsquo;m working on getting a mixer ($150) and some cheap studio headphones ($20) that I can keep in my office. You can use the paypal link below - any donation would help.</p>

<h1>An Apology</h1><br />
I&rsquo;ve received several variations of this message from friends across the internet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ryan, I love the new podcast but your audio quality is terrible.</blockquote><br />
To you, thanks for listening anyways and for the kind words. I apologize about the audio quality. I&rsquo;m working really hard at fixing it. Getting a sound board I can set up with a mix-minus for interview calls will help immensely. I&rsquo;ve also spent many hours (I didn&rsquo;t really have) in the last couple weeks learning everything I can about sound editing and quality. I promise you it will get better - just give me time.</p>
