<p>You may or may not know that I make web sites as a side job. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been doing it off and on for close to ten years, mostly for churches, and use the extra money to supplement my income as a small church pastor.</p>
<p>Today, I want to announce three major changes to my web design business:</p><br />
<h3 class="">I will no longer do church websites for money.</h3>
<p><br>Church websites have been my web design bread and butter for a long time, but I&rsquo;ve always had mixed feelings about doing them. Many of the church websites I&rsquo;ve done have been for small churches with limited budgets and non-tech savvy pastors. &nbsp;While I feel like I understand church websites better than most (being a pastor myself) I&rsquo;ve decided to stop making them for hire.<br><br>I will continue to make websites as a business, but I&rsquo;m going to be focusing on making them for local businesses and not for churches. &nbsp;This will allow me to charge a little more for my work (most churches have very little money) and spend more time with my family. &nbsp;It will also help me to meet some of the businessmen in my community.</p><br />
<h3 class="">I am going to start making websites for free as a ministry of our church.</h3></p>
<p>Instead of making websites for churches and charging them $300, I&rsquo;ve started working on making websites for missionaries and church planters and charging them $0. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My church has allowed me to do this as a missions ministry. &nbsp;We are covering every cost: hosting, domains, etc.. I&rsquo;m trying to put ever bit of effort into making these websites as I would into the websites I make for paying clients. &nbsp;Honestly, I&rsquo;m a lot happier about doing it and feel like it will enable our ministry to be a big help to deserving missionaries and church planters. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a missionary or church planter and you are interested - please drop me a line. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll tell you I&rsquo;ve already started this and am booked through the end of the year.</p><br />
<h3 class="">All of my future sites will use Concrete5 instead of Wordpress as a CMS.</h3>
<p>A few months ago, my church wordpress site was hacked. &nbsp;In the frustration that followed, I started looking into other CMS products. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve taken the last several months to learn Concrete5, which I think is far superior to wordpress for most website applications (although, I&rsquo;ll contintue to use wordpress as my blogging tool of choice.) &nbsp;Concrete5 allows me more freedom in making sites that are truly custom and is easier to use (imho) than Wordpress.<br> <br>From now on, I&rsquo;ll be using Concrete5 &nbsp;in all my web projects.</p></p>
