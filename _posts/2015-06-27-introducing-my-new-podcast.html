<p>I'm at a very busy season in my life. My church is hiring a youth pastor and we are scrambling to get an apartment ready for him by the end of the month. We have VBS less than two weeks. I'm trying to start a local home school coop. I have other important projects I'm trying to finish - all on top of the regular demands of being a pastor- not the least of which is preparing three or four sermons every week. So the very last thing I need I need is another project.</p>
<p>Despite that - I've started a podcast called <strong>"The Foolishness of Preaching."</strong> Am I nuts? A glutton for punishment? Insane on the membrane?</p>
<p>Probably - but I don't think that's why I'm doing this.</p>
<p>On this blog, for the last four years, I've been extremely passionate about one thing - promoting biblical preaching. That's always been the heart of it. Trying to get people to think biblically about the issues in fundamentalism.</p>
<p>A while ago it dawned on me that <strong>the people I most want to influence I never will by blogging</strong>. I don't blame them for that. It's o.k.. If I really want to encourage biblical preaching, it's going to take another, softer, approach.</p>
<p>For awhile I've thought it would be really cool to start a podcast that was just about preaching philosophy, preparation and delivery. To my knowledge, nothing like that exists right now. Starting that podcast, however, brought me face to face with the same problem - no one wants to hear from me. So what to do?</p>
<p>Then I thought of a solution:</p>
<p>What if I could interview respected preachers from all over the country and ask them about their sermon philosophy, how they study, what preachers influenced them, how they plan and prepare their messages? What young preacher has never wanted to be a fly on the wall in the study of some preacher they respect, trying to discern, as much as humanly possible, what goes into their sermons?</p>
<p>So that"s what this podcast is going to be about. You are going to hear very little of Ryan Hayden in it. I'll just ask the questions. The whole thing will be purposely minimalist. No catchy intro music. No word from our sponsor. Just preachers having a thirty to forty-five minute conversation with me and answering questions about their own approach to preaching.</p>
<p>I've already recorded four interviews with many more planned in the coming weeks. It's been awesome. In each interview, I've learned something I can apply in my own ministry to be a better preacher. I'm looking forward to each interview coming up in the future. I'm hoping to release one interview each week.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-help">How can you help?</h2><br />
This thing won't work without your help. Here are several things you can do:<br />
* Subscribe to the "Foolishness of Preaching"¬ù podcast when it's released in a few weeks.<br />
* Help promote the podcast with retweets and shares.<br />
* Check out (and comment on) <a href="http://thefoolishnessofpreaching.com">thefoolishnessofpreaching.com</a>&nbsp;(It's still very much a work in progress, things should change drastically monday.)<br />
* Send me the names of preachers you'd like to hear interviewed, and if you know them, put in a good word.<br />
* Consider helping me with the expenses of the podcast by purchasing the books these preachers recommend through the links on <a href="http://thefoolishnessofpreaching.com">thefoolishnessofpreaching.com</a> or by donating to the podcast.</p>
<p>The biggest thing you can do for me, though, is to spread the word.</p>
