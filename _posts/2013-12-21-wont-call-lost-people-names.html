<p>The recent Duck Dynasty social media meltdown has had me thinking. &nbsp;As I've looked over Facebook and Twitter the last couple of days, I've read all different views on it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homosexuals and homosexual advocates defending the network.</li>
<li>Christians and Christian advocates defending Phil.</li>
<li>Christians against homosexuality who thought Phil shouldn't have given an interview to GQ magazine or spoken so crassly. (That's where I am.)</li>
<li>Professing Christians who used the opportunity to trash homosexuals with words like "queer," "homo," "fairy" and "sodomite."</li><br />
</ul><br />
It's the last group that I'm addressing with this post.</p>
<p><strong>I don't care about Duck Dynasty all that much.</strong> I watch the show for the same reason I watch an NFL game once or twice a season, because the people in my church do and I want to relate to them. The only reason I care is because this whole episode shows how much of a strangle hold the cultural left has on the country, and how they are growing ever bolder against the Bible. Beyond that, I think too much was made of this situation.</p>
<p>What I do care about, very much, is <strong>how professing Christians act towards lost people</strong>. I find it absolutely inexcusable for Christian people to make fun of lost people for...well...being lost people.</p>
<p>No matter what the symptoms of their lostness are: homosexuality, promiscuity, adultery, lying, drunkenness, fornication, pride or any of the other sins the Bible mentions - their lostness is nothing to joke about. It's nothing to bully.</p>
<p>Do those people need to hear what God says about their sin? Absolutely. They need to hear it, however, in the context of the gospel. Not in the context of a rant motivated by fear, entertainment, a partisan spirit or disgust.</p>
<p>The Lord helping me, you will not hear me call lost people names for these reasons:</p>
<h2>1. It's contrary to the gospel.</h2><br />
<em>"Christ Jesus came to save sinners." "He will save His people from their sins." "I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." "They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick." "Blessed are the merciful." "Blessed are the peacemakers." "Such were some of you."</em></p>
<p>Put those phrases next to a preacher making fun of "queers" or "faggots" (their words, not mine.) Put it next to a Christian talking about "all the lousy drunks." Put it next to someone calling a women a "whore." (I've heard all of these out of the mouths of preachers.)</p>
<p>They. Don't. Go. Together.</p>
<p>Jesus himself said, in a fairly well known passage of scripture, that <em>"For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved."</em> (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/John3%3A17" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">John 3:17</a>)<strong> If condemning people wasn't a part of Jesus' mission, should it be a part of ours?</strong> Should our goal be to go around pointing out the sin in others, as if they do not know through their conscience that they are sinning against a Holy God?</p>
<p>We have the good news. Does the good news start with the bad news of human sinfulness? Absolutely. But the purpose of that bad news part is to bring people to the savior, not to give ourselves some warped sense of superiority.</p>
<p>Which brings me to number 2:</p>
<h2>2. It reveals a heart of self-righteousness.</h2><br />
Whenever I hear Christian people put down and make fun of the lost, I'm usually reminded of a certain guy in the Temple who prayed to God and said "I'm thankful that I'm not like that publican. I fast. I tithe. I stay clean. Etc."</p>
<p>Putting down sinners for being sinners reveals a lot about the source of our own righteousness.</p>
<p>We are supposed to be saved by grace. We are supposed to be people who have been miraculously cured of a deep disease that would have eventually brought us to Hell. We are supposed to have obtained that salvation through the unmerited gift of Another, <em>not of works, lest any man should boast.</em></p>
<p>Would a man miraculously cured of cancer, go down to the local cancer ward to make fun of the bald heads and emaciated bodies? I think not. But many professing Christians are willing to look at the sinners around them as fodder for their own pride.</p>
<p><strong>Testimony and trash talk don't go together.</strong> The person who has become poor in spirit and who has mourned his own sinfulness before being filled with righteousness given totally by another is going to be a merciful peacemaker, not a merciless phrase maker.</p>
<p>Whenever we point out the sinfulness of mankind, it should always be with four fingers pointed at ourselves.</p>
<p>Another reason I despise the name calling is because:</p>
<h2>3. It steals our chances to witness.</h2><br />
God has called us to <em>"Go ye therefor and preach the gospel to every creature."</em> He did not call us to preach the gospel only to the caucasian, upwardly mobile, outwardly moral, suit-wearing, pew-sitting, republican-voting church creatures - but to every creature. Our Lord spent his time on this earth preaching to the sinners and the publicans, the most despised sinners in all of jewish society. That's something that is impossible to do while throwing out put downs and insulting labels with the rapidity of a gatling gun.</p>
<p>Did the Lord sometimes use harsh language? Yep. But He reserved his harsh language for spiritually blind religious people. The kind of people who crossed the road to not have to walk by a publican. The kind of people who probably would go around today calling lost people names.</p>
<p>God has given us the ministry of reconciliation. Reconciliation! You don't posture yourself the same way for <em>reconciliation</em> the same way as you posture yourself for <em>recrimination</em>. You don't go after <em>converts</em> the same way you go after <em>casualties</em>.</p>
<p>The last reason I despise name calling, and it's truly the least important of all of them, is...</p>
<h2>4. It justifies the persecution of the church.</h2><br />
Let's see. You've got a television network, a pretty good representative of the cultural left, unfairly labeling the preaching of the Bible as bigoted and hateful. What do you do about it? I know, let's use language that probably is bigoted and hateful. That will help us.</p>
<p>Does anybody else see the problem with that?</p>
<p>They are gonna come after us with everything they've got, do we have to give them YouTube videos of 5-year-olds singing gleefully about "ain't no homos going to heaven?" Do we have to give them soundbites of Independent Baptist preachers ranting about having a "hunt-a-homo week?" Is that necessary? Is that helpful? Seriously??</p>
<p><em>It's absolutely possible to make yourself an enemy of the gospel while trying to defend righteousness.</em> There was a famous group of religious people in the gospels who did just that.</p>
<p>As counterintuitive as it may seem in our current cultural climate - <strong>we need to reach out to those wrongly defending sin and stand against those wrongly defending righteousness - it's what Jesus did.</strong></p>
