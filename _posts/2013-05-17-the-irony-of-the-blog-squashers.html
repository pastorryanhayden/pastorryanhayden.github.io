<p>Recently, there has been some backlash against younger preachers (like myself) for blogging anything critical about the Independent Fundamental Baptist movement. It&rsquo;s as if some are saying &ldquo;Who are these young whippersnappers? How dare they criticize the great men of God upon whose shoulders they stand?&rdquo; We young IFB pastors are beginning to hear, and I&rsquo;m sure it will increase, the collective call of the old guard to go back to the kids table and finish our green beans with cousin Ned and stay out of the grown ups&rsquo; business. Not all older IFB preachers are taking this tone, but some prominent ones are.</p>
<p>I find this ironic for two reasons:</p>
<h3 id="religiousreformisayoungmansgameandalwayshasbeen.">1. Religious reform is a young man&rsquo;s game and always has been.</h3><br />
How old was John the Baptist when he preached against the Pharisees? (Remember they were the conservative religious rulers of their day?) How old was Isaiah or Jeremiah when they started their reforms? How about John Wesley, George Whitfield, D.L. Moody, Charles Spurgeon? (and the list continues)</p>
<p>Under 30.</p>
<p>They were probably all dismissed by their older contemporaries as youthful enthusiasts, flashes in the pan, young upstarts. (We know for a fact that the last four were.) Is that how we know them today?</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/spurgn20.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1168" alt="spurgn20" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/spurgn20.jpg" width="210" height="298" /></a></p>
<p>Go read about the dutch Anabaptists who are our spiritual ancestors. They stood against men like Calvin, Zwingli, and Luther (all of which were godly men and to the right of the religious spectrum of their day.) Not only did they begin their reforms as young men, most of them were martyred as young men.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think myself, or most of the younger men who write and are pushing for reform are anywhere near their calibre of preacher or leader; but, if everyone had the idea that young men&rsquo;s input wasn&rsquo;t valid or valued, there would be many wonderful reforms and revival movements throughout Christian history that would have never happened. That is a historical fact.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re talking about historical facts&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="theindependentfundamentalbaptistmovementwasstartedandledbyyoungermenwhowerecriticaloftheoldguard.">2. The Independent Fundamental Baptist movement was started and led by younger men who were critical of the old guard.</h3><br />
J. Frank Norris, Lee Robberson, John R. Rice, Jerry Falwell, Clarence Sexton, Curtis Hutson - these guys as <strong>young men</strong> decided to go in a different direction than their spiritual forbears. They felt the call to leave (or were forced to leave because of their vocal criticism) the Southern Baptist Convention out of which they were saved, discipled and educated. This no doubt was a disappointment to the many godly pastors and educators who were still in the Convention. Were they not, in a sense, betraying their mentors?</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;ve come to a place where the thing they started, the Independent Baptist movement, has become above criticism. Where young men are put down for doing exactly what the first Independent Baptists did. For checking what their religious context against the Bible and trying to right the differences. For taking a stand.</p>
<p>Isn't it ironic?</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><br />
We young guys need to be careful and we need to be respectful. We weren&rsquo;t saved in a contextual vacuum and we should acknowledge the impact and efforts of those who came before us. We should do everything in our power to keep the lines of communication open between us and older men who have already fought the battle. They are to be treated with utmost respect.</p>
<p>But to you older preachers I say this:</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve chosen to identify as Independent Baptists in a time when that&rsquo;s never been less popular. Many of us have taken stands on separatism, practical christianity, and Bible versions that make us the laughingstock of the professing Christian world. We are dealing with the daily pressures of the pastoral ministry just like our older brethren.</p>
<p>If our ideas about the scripture are untrue - deal with our ideas. By all means, open your Bibles and set us straight. If our ideas about fundamentalist leaders are historically inaccurate - tell us why. Point us to the true history. Talk to us. &nbsp;But please do not take the easy way out and write us off because of our age or lack of experience.</p>
