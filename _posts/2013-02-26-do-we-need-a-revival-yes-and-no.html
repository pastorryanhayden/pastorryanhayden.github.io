<p>I'm going to take a break from the Spurgeon thing today and write some thoughts on Revival. &nbsp;There will probably be more where this comes from. &nbsp;<em><strong>I'm very interested in your thoughts on this. &nbsp;I'm not sure I'm settled on it yet, just working through it.</strong></em> &nbsp;Here it goes...</p>

<p>If I had a dollar every time I&rsquo;ve heard the word "revival" in church in my short life, my church would be meeting in a new building and my car would be paid for. No one can doubt that revival is a theme in fundamentalism and in most Indpendent Baptist Churches. We have yearly &ldquo;revivals&rdquo; (We are having one at our church in a couple of weeks), we talk adoringly of the revivals of times past, we organize revival prayer meetings and we preach often about revival in our times.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/revival.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-802" alt="revival" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/revival-300x240.jpg" width="300" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>But for a long time, I have not been big on talking about revival.</p>
<p>Let me quantify that last statement, <strong>I'm not been big on what most people define as revival.</strong></p>
<p>If you define revival as God&rsquo;s people getting back to healthy, powerful and biblical Christianity, then I&rsquo;m all for it. In fact, I&rsquo;m praying (and working) for that kind of revival. I&rsquo;d really like to see it happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet, however, that most people probably don&rsquo;t think of revival that way. Most probably think of it as some awesome experience. Most probably think of it as some emotional crisis. Most probably think that there are two kinds of Christians, those who have received a revival and those who haven&rsquo;t. Most probably think "if I could just see a revival, then I&rsquo;d be the spiritual Christian God wants me to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That kind of revival emphasis is both unbiblical and dangerous.</p>
<h3 id="itsunbiblicalbecauseitiscompletelyforeigntonewtestamentchristianity.">It&rsquo;s unbiblical because it is completely foreign to New Testament Christianity.</h3><br />
Go find a Bible and search the <strong>New Testament</strong> for a revival themed passage&hellip; having trouble? Me too.</p>
<p>You might say the first half of the book of Acts, but that&rsquo;s not a Christian revival, that&rsquo;s more of a Christian &ldquo;vival&rdquo;. &nbsp;("revival" means to bring back to life, Acts was bringing the church to life in the first place.) The primary difference between Baptists and charismatics is that we believe that those signs and wonders and the &ldquo;spiritual activity&rdquo; that we see in Acts was just there to establish the New Testament church.</p>
<p>There were revivals in the Old Testament. Usually, they were the children of Israel repenting of their sins and turning back to the Lord, and usually God blessed them materially for it.</p>
<p>But we aren&rsquo;t the children of Israel. We aren&rsquo;t in bondage. The message of the New Testament isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;go back to the law&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;go forward following Christ and doing what He wants us to do&rdquo;. They are totally different.</p>
<p>Can the New Testament church have a revival? Absolutely. They can go into God&rsquo;s word and do what they were supposed to be doing in the first place. But this won&rsquo;t be accomplished by a revival emphasis, it will be accomplished by sound teaching and obedience to the principles of the New Testament. No &ldquo;R Word&rdquo; needed.</p>
<p>[box &nbsp;type="note"]<br />
Someone might say "what about the Great Awakening and other revivals?" I'm not denying that they happened, but I don't think in any of those great revivals, the emphasis was on "revival," the emphasis was on scriptural regeneration, or practical Christianity, or missions, etc.<br />
[/box]</p>
<p>But beyond it&rsquo;s questionable place in New Testament Christianity,&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="anemphasisonrevivalisdangerousbecauseitkeepspeoplelookingforsomethingthatisntcomingandremovestheimpulsetoobeygodtoday.">An emphasis on that kind revival is dangerous because it keeps people looking for something that isn&rsquo;t coming, and removes the impulse to obey God today.</h3><br />
We don&rsquo;t see Peter, Paul, James, John, Timothy, Titus, John Mark, Lydia, or anybody else after the first couple of chapters of Acts praying for a revival. We see them teaching the Bible and living out it&rsquo;s principles. We see them striving to fulfill the great commission. We see them acting.</p>
<p>One of the main dangers of a revival emphasis is it keeps people looking for God to <strong>do</strong> something when He already <strong>did</strong> something. We already have our marching orders. He&rsquo;s already given us His Word. We have already been baptized by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>How do we live the Christian life to it&rsquo;s fullest? Do we need to &ldquo;pray through.&rdquo; Do we need a second blessing? Do we need some powerful experience?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;According as his divine power <strong>hath given</strong> unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, <strong>through the knowledge of him</strong> that hath called us to glory and virtue: 4 Whereby <strong>are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature,</strong> having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.&rdquo;</em> 2 Peter 1:3&ndash;4</blockquote><br />
According to this passage, God has already given us everything we need <em>&ldquo;for life and godliness&rdquo;</em> and He&rsquo;s given it to us through knowing Him through His Word. We&rsquo;re not supposed to be looking for some spiritual zap from Heaven that will make us uber-humans. We are supposed to be walking day by day in the Word of God.</p>
<p>I'll probably write some more about this in the next couple days.<br />
What do you think? Am I off base? Let me know in the comments. (I've purposely avoided the "Revival is manmade - revival is a sovereign act of God" argument. I might save that for a later post.)</p>
