<p>Last Friday, I got to preach in chapel at the Christian School where I attended from 5th grade through High School. (I also taught there for two school years.) It was an awesome privilege and it was great to see some of my former students. (They were third and fourth graders when I taught them and they are Juniors and Seniors now, so they didn't quite look the same.)</p>
<p>After chapel, a young man came up to me, told me he felt called to preach, and asked me if I had any advice for him as a preacher who had been almost exactly where he was. I wasn't expecting the question, and was a little flattered that he asked it, but here is what I told him (expanded a little):</p>
<h2>1. You are going to be an awful preacher for awhile.</h2><br />
Every preacher you've ever heard was downright awful when he started preaching. Every one. I've heard early sermons from preachers like Clarence Sexton (one of my favorite preachers) and they were pitiful. In retrospect, yours will be too. It's o.k.. Preach them anyway, it's a part of it.</p>
<h2>2. Get all of the practice that you can.</h2><br />
When I was a young preacher, I preached in nursing homes, I preached in morning Bible studies at my Christian school, I preached on the bus route, and I preached in little mini-sessions with my youth group. I took every opportunity I could. Then, as (a lot of) time went by, I got opportunities to preach in chapel services, and Sunday school classes and eventually in church (very rarely.) Me and some friends in college would even hike down a ravine near our dorm and preach to each other for practice.</p>
<p>You need practice. It takes about 20,000 hours of doing something to be great at it. (I've been in the full time ministry for 8 years and haven't even come close <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Tobit14" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">to 20</a>,000 hours of preaching.) So take every opportunity you have to practice, take it seriously, and preach the message God gives you. Don't look at it as a stepping stone, look at it as the ministry that God has given you today. Be faithful in the little things and God will bless you with bigger.</p>
<h2>3. Getting the content of the Bible right is about 1,000,000 more important than being a good speaker, so learn to study the scripture.</h2><br />
If you are the greatest speaker in the world and able to move people to an altar every service, but can't get the content of the Bible right, all you are going to do is mislead people. Learning to speak well is important, but learning what to speak is infinitely more so. The most important part of your education as a preacher is learning how to study and interpret the Bible - everything else is downstream of that.</p>
<h2>4. Get any ideas about being a "great" preacher out of your head.</h2><br />
The biggest hurdle you will face in the coming years is an unlikely one - your own pride. I know that for me personally, there were so many times that my ambition got ahead of God's plan for me then, and it made me miserable.</p>
<p>You are first and foremost a servant of God. Servants don't get accolades - they get jobs to do and if they do them well, get rest and provision. Just serve God where you are and don't get ahead of God's plan for you.</p>
<h2>5. Realize you are in it for the long haul.</h2><br />
In all likelihood, if you are called to preach, you will probably be in a period of preparation until you are close <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Tobit14" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">to 30</a>. (I know I was.) Fifteen years is a very long time, and it can be a frustrating time. You'll most likely spend a good deal of that time doing something that doesn't have people calling you "pastor." Don't despise it - you'll learn some of your most important lessons in that time. If God has called you - stick with it and do your best and He will bless you in due time.</p>
