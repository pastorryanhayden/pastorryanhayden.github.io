<p>It's amazing what people worry about. I had an aunt who spent thousands preparing for Y2K. &nbsp;She even bought a palette of her favorite hair die (apparently she believed that even under apocalyptic conditions, people would care to notice her grey hairs). Some people spend vast amounts of money on home security systems, others douse themselves in sanitizing chemicals several times a day hoping to fight off germs. People take time to worry about food chemicals, TSA screenings, cell phone radiation, social security and even global warming.</p></p>
<p>In Matthew 6:25-34 Jesus commands us not to worry. He said "Take no thought for your life", word's a phrase that comes from two words one meaning "don't" and the other meaning "have anxiety". Literally, Jesus says "don't worry".</p></p>
<p>In our passage this morning, <strong>Jesus gives three compelling reasons why we shouldn't worry</strong>.</p></p>
<h3>First, we shouldn't worry because we really aren't in control of much and thus worry changes nothing.</h3></p>
<p>When you really think about it, there isn't much in this life that you are in control of. You didn't choose who your parents are, you didn't choose your height, your hair color (unless you dye it) your eye color, or your complexion. You most likely had very little input as to what part of the country you grew up in. Your schools were chosen for you, your friends picked from a limited selection, and your tastes were in large part inherited by all a mixture of all of these other things you didn't choose. You are not the pilot of your own destiny, you may have the steering wheel now, but takeoff, general direction, and the make and model of the plane were chosen by someone else.</p></p>
<p>So what't the use of worry? Jesus asked it this way "which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature?" or "which of you can worry an extra foot onto your height?". When we choose to dwell on things that aren't in our control, all we do is waste time and depress ourselves.</p></p>
<h3>Second, we shouldn't worry because worry just brings tomorrow's problems into today.</h3></p>
<p>I don't mean to depress you, but we could get nuked tomorrow. An enormous volcano could rise up out of the cornfields and burn us all up (don't smirk, it happened once in an area like this in Mexico). Our stock market and financial system could collapse on itself. Someone we love could die.</p></p>
<p>All of this could happen tomorrow, but could you change any of it? No! Jesus said <em>"Take therefore no thought for</em> (don't worry about) <em>the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself."</em> We are absolutely commanded not to worry about the future. Remember what Corrie Ten Boom said "Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow. It empties today of its strength."</p></p>
<h3>Third, we shouldn't worry because we serve a sovereign, all-powerful God.</h3></p>
<p>The main reason that we shouldn't worry is because of our faith in God and our desire to serve Him. A private on the battlefield doesn't get the luxury about worrying about the general's orders, it's his place to obey them and trust that the general is in control and knows what he is doing.</p></p>
<p>As Christians, our "orders" come from He who controls everything, and He who has already won the battle. Not only does he look after our best interest, he is feeding the sparrows. We must march forward seeking His kingdom with the full assurance that "all these things will be added unto us".</p></p>
