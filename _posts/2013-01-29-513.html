<p>This is part 3 of a series of posts on <strong>&ldquo;Making Sense in the Noise Machine.</strong>&rdquo; My personal rules for sharing content and commenting on the internet.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, you may want to read the <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/making-sense-in-the-noise-machine-my-rules-for-sharing-in-blogs-and-social-media/">introduction</a>, and my <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/making-sense-in-the-noise-machine-be-informed/">first rule</a>.</p>
<p>[/box]</p>
<p>My second rule for sharing and posting on the internet is:</p>
<h1 id="beideadriven">Be idea driven</h1><br />
<a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/fight.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-514" alt="fight" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/fight-300x215.jpg" width="300" height="215" /></a></p>
<p>One of the things that I&rsquo;ve found as I&rsquo;ve written in various places on the internet is that most people don&rsquo;t know how to express opposition civilly and intelligently. The web is full of name calling, attacks on character, us-versus-them cheerleading, and &ldquo;the world is coming to an end if&rdquo; types of arguments. In other words, when faced with ideas or information that makes us uncomfortable, most of us don&rsquo;t know how to oppose the ideas, so we oppose the people who present them.</p>
<p>This kind of defensive opposition really does no good. When we get defensive, our ideological opponents get defensive. When we bring out the cruise missile of an insult, they start looking for weapons of mass destruction of their own. All you end up with are bruised egos and a bigger divide.</p>
<p>I find it helpful on the internet to always strive to be idea driven. Here&rsquo;s what I mean:</p>
<h2 id="attackideasnotpeople.">Attack ideas, not people.</h2><br />
The other day I put a<a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/letter-to-the-editor-the-threat-to-religious-liberty/"> letter to the editor</a> in the newspaper about some homosexual rights legislation being pushed through our state assembly. I didn&rsquo;t call anybody names. I didn&rsquo;t write anything that hadn&rsquo;t been verified. Yet, I couldn&rsquo;t believe the comments on the newspaper website. Apparently, being opposed to gay marriage for religious reasons makes me a hater, a fear monger and a bigot. Also, plenty of people are glad that I am not their pastor, and glad to let me know.</p>
<p>The common thread in 96% of the negative comments was that <em>the commenters were attacking me, and saying nothing about what I wrote.</em></p>
<p>One comment was different, it&rsquo;s author stated disagreement and then pointed out what he saw as a flaw in my argument. I thanked him for his comment, did some research, and rethought what I&rsquo;d said. He didn&rsquo;t change my mind about the whole argument, but he changed my mind about one part of it.</p>
<p>Nothing good comes from attacking people for having an opinion. Attack the opinion itself, try to show what&rsquo;s wrong with it, but don&rsquo;t attack people.</p>
<p>Which brings me to another part of being idea driven:</p>
<h2 id="trytochangepeoplesmindnotmakepeoplelookbad.">Try to change peoples mind, not make people look bad.</h2><br />
One of the negative side effects of the internet is the polarization of our society. We all tend to develop an us verses them mentality and as a result &ldquo;defeat them&rdquo; becomes a goal. In the book of Acts, we see Paul going to synagogues and city squares, and in all of those places, he faced instant opposition. We never read where Paul went into attack mode and tried to make the Jews or Gentiles feel stupid or look bad for having bad ideas, rather, we see him working hard and long <em>reasoning</em> with people to <em>persuade</em> them about the truth of Jesus Christ. (Acts 17:2, 2 Cor. 5:11)</p>
<p>In any ideological battle <strong>we should remember that we aren&rsquo;t after casualties, but converts</strong>. You can&rsquo;t get converts if you can&rsquo;t keep an audience in the first place. This is why being idea driven is so important.</p>
<p>Remember the wisdom from Proverbs:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger. The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.&rdquo;</em> <strong>Proverbs 15:1&ndash;2</strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.&rdquo;</em> <strong>Proverbs 25:15</strong></blockquote><br />
It applies to the internet too.</p>
<h2 id="avoidthetaboosofcivilargument.">Avoid the taboos of civil argument.</h2><br />
Some of you may have studied debate or logic in school, I did not. I went through high school, college and some graduate school before I learned on my own that their have been rules governing civil discourse for hundreds of years. If you take the time to do a quick study of the &ldquo;logical fallacies&rdquo; and you try to apply that knowledge, I guarantee your conversation will be elevated to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Here are some of the main ones (there are many more):</p>
<ul>
<li>ad hominem attacks - attacking the person, not the idea. (i.e. "The only thing that you just proved is that you&rsquo;re an idiot.")</li>
<li>false-dichotomies - assuming that there are only two possibilities, when there could be more. (i.e. "Either you are a conservative or a liberal.")</li>
<li>guilt by association - assuming because an idea is associated with a person or other idea, it is false. (i.e. "Adolf Hitler said that once, it must be evil.")</li>
<li>straw men - attacking an argument that nobody holds to make yourself look good. (i.e. "Lordship salvation people believe that once you are saved you never sin and live in perfect submission to Christ.")</li><br />
</ul><br />
I&rsquo;ve found<a href="http://carm.org/logical-fallacies-or-fallacies-argumentation" target="_blank"> this list</a> on the carm.org website to be very helpful. (I know little about their organization and just found this via a google search. So don't view the link as an endorsement.)</p>
<p>If I cannot make an argument in a way that is levelheaded or logical, then I must&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="considerthepossibilitythatiamwrong.">Consider the possibility that I am wrong.</h2><br />
Obviously, as a Christian I am going to accept scripture as rock solid and not question it. But if the cause I am espousing is extra-biblical (economic politics for example) and I can&rsquo;t discuss it logically in an idea centric way. I might need to admit to myself that either 1) <a title="Making Sense in the Noise Machine: Be Informed." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/making-sense-in-the-noise-machine-be-informed/" target="_blank">I don&rsquo;t know enough about this topic to be discussing it in a public forum</a> or 2) I might be wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that when I approach a discussion trying to change people&rsquo;s minds, sometimes my mind is changed, and that&rsquo;s not a bad thing.</p>

<p>Do have your own ideas about civil discourse or being idea driven on the internet. Please, let me know in the comments.</p>
