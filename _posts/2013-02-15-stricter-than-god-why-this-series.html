<p>All week I&rsquo;ve been posting about the dangers of being &ldquo;Stricter than God.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m fairly certain, that some people have read it as an attack on personal or institutional standards or on applying the scripture, despite the fact that I have tried pretty hard to make it clear that that wasn&rsquo;t what I was after.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t care for the word standards, mostly because I think it&rsquo;s because I think it&rsquo;s been overused and because I think the word itself invites a judgmental attitude (think &ldquo;golden standard&rdquo; or &ldquo;standards of measurement.&rdquo; A standard is something used for measuring.) I&rsquo;m not against having standards (personal or institutional rules based on biblical principles) so much as I am against emphasizing them. Particularly against emphasizing them at the expense of the Bible.</p>
<h2 id="toomanyemphasizestandards.">Too many emphasize standards.</h2><br />
I want to tread carefully here, because I believe I owe a debt of loyalty to those who have loved me in Christ and who God used greatly in my life. But I came up in an environment where standards were worked into every sermon, where standards were treated as a hallmark of Christianity, and where because of standards, the actual teachings of scripture took a backseat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been all over the eastern part of our country, and have attended two fundamentalist colleges and through that have come into contact with many, many pastors and church leaders who share the same tendency to emphasize standards over scripture.</p>
<p>Again, I am not against having personal standards, I am against letting those personal standards replace the deeper and more important parts of scripture. I&rsquo;m against emphasizing personal standards. I&rsquo;m against teaching personal standards as the means for sanctification.</p>
<h2 id="imnotsomerebelrousertryingtogainchristiansthefreedomtoliveliketheworld.">I&rsquo;m not some rebel rouser trying to gain Christians the freedom to live like the world.</h2><br />
By many peoples estimation, my family has high personal standards. My wife doesn&rsquo;t wear pants outside of our house. I keep my hair cut short and comb it to the side. I wear a suit and tie to church. We sing only hymns. I do not listen to rock and pop music. The only movie I&rsquo;ve attended in the last seven years was an early morning documentary on the Obama administration. I don&rsquo;t attend any non-fundamentalist conferences or have non-fundamentalists preach in my church. I preach and study only the KJV. I don&rsquo;t gamble. I totally abstain from alcohol. Need I go on?</p>
<p>Again, I have no personal vendetta against having personal or institutional standards, I have a personal vendetta against emphasizing them at the expense of scripture.</p>
<h2 id="theimportanceofgettingemphasisright.">The importance of getting emphasis right.</h2><br />
I&rsquo;m an expository preacher. I preach through books of the Bible. I believe that we should emphasize what scripture emphasizes. I believe God knew what He was doing when He gave us His word. If you have to draw a standard from principles drawn from 3 obscure verses in the Old Testament, it may be perfectly valid application of scripture, but unless any one of those passages was written for the purpose of defining that standard, you can&rsquo;t say that scripture emphasizes it.</p>
<p>Did God know what He was doing when He wrote the scripture? Then why do we emphasize and make such a big deal about things that aren&rsquo;t emphasized in scripture?</p>
<p>The pharisees had scripture. The pharisees loved scripture. The pharisees wanted to live a Holy life according to scripture. <strong>They missed the emphasis.</strong> Look at where that put them. All I&rsquo;m saying is that we are in danger of doing the very same thing.</p>
<p>Next week I plan to write about making sure we don't try to press Jesus or Christianity into our cultural mold.. &nbsp;Add me to your RSS reader or sign up for the email list. &nbsp;Thanks for reading.</p>
