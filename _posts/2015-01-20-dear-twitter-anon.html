<p>Dear twitter anon:</p>
<p>It may surprise many people to know that I don&rsquo;t spend hours every day on social media, delighting in the latest controversy and chuckling at the antics of anonymous folks on twitter with names mashing up pop culture and christianity. I&rsquo;m a pastor, I&rsquo;m a dad, I&rsquo;m a husband, I do a lot of work for missionaries and I&rsquo;m seriously addicted to spending time in my wood shop. I may spend a grand total of 15 minutes every day on all forms of social media, and what I see there usually bores or saddens me.</p>
<p>Below is my advice to Christian twitter anons. It may seem harsh, but believe me, it&rsquo;s not intended to do you harm. I&rsquo;m not your enemy and you aren&rsquo;t mine. Some of the things you say I agree with, I just wish you would say it a different way. So please don&rsquo;t take this as another grumpy fundy with an axe to grind because that&rsquo;s not my spirit here.</p>
<p>Here goes&hellip;</p>
<h3>1. Come out from the shadows.</h3><br />
Imagine a person dressing up like Chuck Norris, Walter White, or Jack Hyles and going into an independent Baptist church to make fun of the people there. Even the weirdest of human beings probably wouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>The internet is a weird place. A generation ago, I doubt many could imagine a place where a bunch of people could say whatever they want anonymously, where they could form little communities with other anonymous people, where they could take on some satirical alter ego to lambast&nbsp;a group they didn&rsquo;t like with no fear of reprisal. Yet that&rsquo;s exactly what we have today on Twitter.</p>
<p>I write some controversial things. I&rsquo;ve said some things that have ruffled feathers and I&rsquo;ve picked fights, sometimes unwisely, with powerful people. Yet everything I&rsquo;ve done has had my name, my picture, and my reputation attached to it.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons for that, but the main one is that by having my real name out there, it keeps me from saying things I&rsquo;ll be ashamed of later on.</p>
<p>In my mind, the only reason to be anonymous is because you would be ashamed of what you are saying in real life. The only reason to do it is because you fear the consequence of saying what you are saying in real life behind your real name.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be a coward. Don&rsquo;t be dishonest. Don&rsquo;t hide behind some fake internet parody account. If what you are saying needs to be said - you&rsquo;ll do far more good by living a life worth respecting and attaching what you say to that life. That&rsquo;s how normal human beings have done it since the world began.</p>
<h3>2. Grow up.</h3><br />
I imagine another reason people would give to remain anonymous is &ldquo;it&rsquo;s fun.&rdquo; O.k.. I got you there. I imagine it is fun. I imagine it&rsquo;s fun to make fun of people, even powerful and famous people, and to say whatever you want. I can see that.</p>
<p>It may be fun, but it&rsquo;s also sophomoric. It&rsquo;s actually sixthgradeic (If I can coin a word.)</p>
<p>Can you imagine the Apostle Paul or Charles Spurgeon or John Wesley putting on a costume in anonymity and mocking people? I can&rsquo;t. Think of the men and leaders who you truly respect, can you imagine them doing this?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be juvenile. I don&rsquo;t agree with everything you say, but I do agree with some of it, and it&rsquo;s too important to be written off as the hangups of a bunch of keyboard jesters.</p>
<h3>3. Get a life.</h3><br />
By that I mean, do yourself a favor and stop spending so much time on the internet. Go make something. Build a piece of furniture. Cook a new recipe. Go fishing or hunting. Better yet, go play ball with your kids. Go take your wife out on a date. Go read a decent book. Learn a new skill. Do something in real life.</p>
<p>I would go insane - literally insane - if I lived in the world of Twitter. It&rsquo;s a giant and nebulous echo chamber of vanity. At the end of the day, when you pillow your head at night, I&rsquo;m guessing you know that none of this really matters - so go focus on the things that do.</p>
<p>In my experience - I look at a screen as I prepare sermons. I look at a screen as I read books. I look at a screen as I work on websites. For my sanity - I have to do things in my limited free time with my hands in the real world. I&rsquo;m telling you this as your friend - you&rsquo;ll be much happier and more satisfied if you put the phone away and do something.</p>
<p>I have one more word of advice to you&hellip;</p>
<h3>4. Go find something positive you believe in and work for it.</h3><br />
As your friend I&rsquo;m telling you - don&rsquo;t anchor your life and your reputation to what you are against - find something that you believe in and work for it. If you don&rsquo;t like the way a certain church is run - that&rsquo;s your prerogative - so find a church that does preach the Bible and is doing right and invest your life there.</p>
<p>If the Bible is true, at the end of the day we will stand and give an account to God for how we spent our time. You won&rsquo;t answer for what so-and-so did wrong, but for what you did right. So find something you believe in and pour your life into it. Teach a Sunday School class. Find some poor kids who have little hope and invest your life into them. Use your manifest Photoshop and internet skills to help a church keep their website up to date. There are hundreds of positive things you could do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you this as a young guy who probably struggles with the same things you struggle with. It can consume you. It can rob time from your family. It can rob time from your ministry. It can rob you of your sanity.</p>
<p>There is a better way. Take a stand - but stand in the light. Speak in a way that your enemies are ashamed because they have no evil thing to say of you. If what you are doing is truly a good work - then put it on a candlestick&nbsp;- not under the bushel&nbsp;of a goofy twitter handle.</p>
