<p>I&rsquo;m attempting to write more this year. I&rsquo;ll be blogging a couple times a week and posting to social media every day. My reasoning for doing this is I am working on a book, and all of the advice I&rsquo;ve gotten (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Platform-Get-Noticed-Noisy-World/dp/159555503X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359413533&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=platform">Platform</a> by <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/">Micheal Hyatt</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/APE-Author-Publisher-Entrepreneur-How-Publish/dp/0988523108/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359413586&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ape">APE</a> by <a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a>) says that in today&rsquo;s market, you have to make your own market for a book (through the internet) if you want it to do well.</p>
<p><strong>Heres the thing: A big part of me doesn&rsquo;t want to do it.</strong> <em>I loathe the internet noise machine.</em> My Facebook and Twitter timelines are constantly filled with uninformed, cruel, or just plain pointless posts. I read a lot of blogs, and many of them are great, but many of them are just hot air. They add nothing of value. The last thing I want to do is to add more stupidity to the world of social media or more hot air to the blogosphere. (I can&rsquo;t believe I just used that word.)</p>

<p>So, this week, I am going to do a series of blog posts about my personal rules for sharing on the internet. These are the rules that I apply every time I post something about politics, morality or a church issue (I really don't think about them when I'm posting a picture of my kids.) I like to think of them as a checklist that I run through before I ever hit &ldquo;post&rdquo; or &ldquo;publish.&rdquo; Personally, I think that if people everywhere lived by these rules, the internet would be a better place. (By the way, they work for real world communication too.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling this series <strong>&ldquo;Making Sense in the Noise Machine.&rdquo;</strong> I plan on posting every day. Below is my outline (and as the posts are written, it will also become a table of contents.)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wp.me/p2cxH4-87">Be informed</a></li>
<li><a title="Making Sense in the Noise Machine: Be Idea Driven." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/513/">Be Idea Driven</a></li>
<li><a title="Making Sense in the Noise Machine: Be helpful." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/making-sense-in-the-noise-machine-be-helpful/">Be helpful</a></li>
<li><a title="Making Sense in the Noise Machine: Be Cautious." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/making-sense-in-the-noise-machine-be-cautious/">Be cautious</a></li>
<li>Be humble</li><br />
</ul><br />
If you have any ideas for this series, or just want to share your rules, let me know in the coments.</p>
