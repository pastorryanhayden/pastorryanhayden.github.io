<p>This is part 2 of a series of posts on<strong> &ldquo;Making Sense in the Noise Machine.&rdquo;</strong> My personal rules for sharing content and commenting on the internet.</p>
<p>To read the <a href="http://wp.me/p2cxH4-81">introduction, click here</a>.</p>
<p>[/box]</p>
<p>The first rule I try to follow is:</p>
<h1 id="beinformed">Be informed</h1><br />
Before Facebook, before Twitter, before Blogger and Wordpress, if you wanted to publish information you had to <strong>1)</strong> stand in someone&rsquo;s face and say it or <strong>2)</strong> go through a traditional newspaper or publisher. The internet hasn&rsquo;t just removed the face to face aspect of communication, it&rsquo;s also taken away the <em>gatekeepers</em> (the editors and publishers whose job it was to keep poor content out of print.)</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Bookshelf.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-508 alignleft" alt="Bookshelf" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Bookshelf-1024x680.jpg" width="375" height="249" /></a></p>
<p>This has created two problems: First, you can publish whatever you want, no matter how ridiculous or untrue, and no one will proofread it besides your intended audience. Second, you can access a bunch of false or uninformed information and easily pass it on. The net effect of the internet and social media is that it has acted as a magnifier of bad ideas, misinformation, half-cocked criticism, and arm-chair-quarterbacking.</p>
<p>I mean, how did we ever know who to vote for before the advent of Facebook memes depicting Obama as one of the three stooges? How did we ever have a gun control discussion before NRA wallpapers or Youtube videos from liberals depicting &ldquo;2nd Amendment Fails?&rdquo; How did we have theological discussions without internet watch dogs pointing out ever misstep of some famous pastor?</p>
<p>We could all do with less uniformed nonsense on the internet. My pastor in college, Clarence Sexton, told us in chapel once</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you want people to think you are intelligent, never talk about things you don&rsquo;t know anything about.&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
Yet the internet is full of people doing just that. To borrow from the Lincoln quote, they aren&rsquo;t just being thought of as fools, they are opening their mouths (or laptops) and removing all doubt.</p>
<p>I try very hard to stay informed, and write informed things on my blog and my social media accounts. Here are some things I do to that end:</p>
<h2 id="readactualbooksandnewspapersnotjustblogs.">Read actual books and newspapers, not just blogs.</h2><br />
The internet is great, but for the reasons stated above, it&rsquo;s not always the best place for disseminating ideas or truthful news. While, I&rsquo;m grateful for the many wonderful blogs that I read, they aren&rsquo;t quite up to the caliber of books. So before I&rsquo;ll post on a political or theological topic, I try to have read at least one real book about it. Before I post on a news happening, I try to read an article about it from a reputable newspaper.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading seriously (at least 1 non-fiction book a week) for my entire adult life and I&rsquo;ve got rules even for the books I&rsquo;ll read. If I&rsquo;m reading about politics for example, I try to read a book written by an academic (like Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza or Thomas Sowell) and avoid books by Partisan commentators (like Hannity or Limbaugh.) If it&rsquo;s a book about a theological issue or religious history, I try to avoid books written by people with an axe to grind.</p>
<h2 id="verifymyreferences.">Verify my references.</h2><br />
When I&rsquo;m going to write or post on something, the last thing I want to do is pass on false information. If someone tells me something that&rsquo;s sensational, I&rsquo;m going to make sure I can prove it before I write about it. The internet makes this very easy.</p>
<p>An example: Last week I was meeting with a local pastor friend who had just met with a state senator. The senator told him about some legislation moving through our general assembly that could have serious negative effects on churches. While I totally trust my pastor friend, the first thing I did was look up the bill on the Illinois government web site and call the sponsoring State Senator&rsquo;s office to ask them about it. After that, I called the local office of a non-profit that works with that issue and had a conversation with them about it. Then, I read as many newspaper articles as I could about it. Then, I wrote about it.</p>
<h2 id="considerthesource.">Consider the source.</h2><br />
Even if I&rsquo;ve read a book or a newspaper article about something, sometimes, I still have my doubts. Some sources are better than others. Some sources are not to be trusted. Is the source of your information extremely partisan? (Like a talk radio host.) Do they have a vested interest in coloring their information a certain way? (Like a lobbying group.) Are they constantly passing on conspiracy theories or have they built their name through finding faults in others? While no news source is completely objective, I always try to consider if maybe this news is skewed by a preexisting agenda.</p>
<h2 id="ifyouhavenothingtoaddaddnothing.">If I have nothing to add, I add nothing.</h2><br />
I&rsquo;ve already mentioned this, but sometimes it&rsquo;s just better to keep my mouth (or my keyboard shut.) As Proverbs says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.&rdquo;</em> <strong>Proverbs 29:11</strong></blockquote><br />
Quickly spouting off my half-formed opinion may seem tempting, but with the permanent nature of the internet, it&rsquo;s a great way to do long term harm to my credibility.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll be posting about my second rule: be helpful. If you have any ideas, or you want to weigh in on this subject, then tell me about it in the comments.</p>
