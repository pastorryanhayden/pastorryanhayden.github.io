<p>Certain words have developed a bad meaning in fundamentalist circles, and while they are totally neutral or even positive outside of fundamentalism, can serve as insults all by themselves within fundamentalism. A great example is the word &ldquo;contemporary.&rdquo; The other day when I told an old mentor the name of our church theme this year (&ldquo;Out of the Box&rdquo;) he said &ldquo;That sounds a little bit contemporary.&rdquo; He&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;intend it as a compliment.<br />
So what&rsquo;s the matter with &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo;?</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/?attachment_id=320" rel="attachment wp-att-320"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-320" alt="contemporary" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/contemporary-300x172.png" width="300" height="172" /></a><br />
As I understand it, the word &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo; started to take on a negative connotation when &ldquo;Contemporary Christian Music&rdquo; or CCM became popular. I am not a fan of 99% of what comes out of the Contemporary Christian Music movement and am one of those who still believes that certain styles of music &ldquo;rock, pop, rap, etc.&rdquo; are inappropriate when paired with gospel or worship words. I too gag when I get the monthly invites to some Contemporary Christian Youth Festival headlined by some hip sounding band whose members have green hair and a collection of visible body piercings. So in that sense, I don&rsquo;t want to be contemporary.</p>

<p>But in another sense, I very much want to be contemporary. Long ago, I stopped trying to be a fifty-year-old man in a twenty-year-old&rsquo;s body and accepted the fact that I am a man in my twenties living in the 21st century. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I stopped trying to dress like a man in his sixties, stopped looking at design and decor like a man in his sixties, and pretty much embraced the fact that God put me here, in 2012. I cannot tell you how liberating that is for a young preacher.<br />
I believe that it is completely possible to reject the anti-biblical tenets of our society without trying to bring our society back to the 1950s (or whatever other golden age you long for.) I remember having a conversation about &ldquo;the good old years&rdquo; with my grandfather (who was not a Christian) before he passed away, and I remember him telling me quite sternly that the good old days never were. People were immoral sinners in the 1930s just like they will be immoral sinners in the 2030s. They were just better at hiding it. Beaver Cleaver and Roy Rogers were works of fiction; the world was never really &nbsp;like that and won&rsquo;t be until Christ comes back.<br />
So while I reject the Contemporary Christian Music movement and don&rsquo;t want to be known as a hipster pastor, I&rsquo;m not running away from the label &ldquo;contemporary.&rdquo; When people come into our church, I want them to see it as timeless, not trendy, but I also want them to see it as a place that looks like it belongs in 2013, not 1963. We use a screen. Many of the hymns we sing were written in the last thirty years. I read my notes from an iPad. I reference our website. Our church is decorated in a classy way, but not traditionally. If that makes us &ldquo;contemporary,&rdquo; then I&rsquo;m OK with that.<br />
I&rsquo;m of the opinion that we need to focus on what the Bible actually says we should be and&nbsp;shouldn't&nbsp;be rather than pick an arbitrary date in time and reject outright 99% of the cultural changes that came after it. I know that&rsquo;s harder and I know that it might confuse some people, but easy and simple&nbsp;aren't&nbsp;always synonymous with best. I think the benefits far outweigh the costs.</p>
