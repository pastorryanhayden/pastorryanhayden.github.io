<p>What follows was originally written as a blog post to the church I pastor:</p></p>
<p><strong><em>I</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>am thankful that I pastor an independent Baptist church.&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;Being an Independent Baptist allows us to be separate from denominations that support people who do not believe as we believe; it allows us to independently support missionaries and other gospel works without fear that our support money will go towards causes which we feel are contrary to scripture.&nbsp; As an independent church, we are free to follow the Bible, and we answer only to God.&nbsp; I believe with all my heart that the independent, autonomous model of church is more scriptural than the denominational model of church.&nbsp; I wouldn't want to be anything but an independent Baptist.</p></p>
<p>That being said, I am increasingly alarmed by the reputation other churches are giving independent Baptists.&nbsp; Because we are independent and because each church is its own authority, we have absolutely no control over what other independent Baptist churches do.&nbsp; Yet, because of the name on our sign, we will sometimes be associated with them.&nbsp; More and more, independent Baptist churches are becoming known as places where preachers preach on hollow issues at the expense of scriptural teaching, where pastors are treated as kings and have almost no accountability, where loyalty to institutions and leaders is taken to ridiculous extremes, and where petty preferences and external, extra-biblical rules are taking the place of biblical holiness.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in fulfilling my duty of&nbsp;<em>"earnestly contending for the faith once delivered to the saints" (Jude 3),</em>&nbsp;I feel the need to contend with people with whom I used to associate and who also self-identify as independent Baptists.</p></p>
<p>I don't think changing our name and jumping ship is the best response to these changes.&nbsp; The best response, in my opinion, is to be the kind of church that God wants us to be,&nbsp;<em>"that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you." (Titus 2:8)&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;I am too grateful for our fundamental, independent Baptist heritage to see it hijacked by an unscriptural caricature of Christianity, and I will "fight like mad" to make sure that people know that these erroneous views and practices aren't representative of all independent Baptist churches.</p></p>
