<p>This week, I'm posting the beliefs that I hold that, even if I wanted to be a mainline evangelical, would keep me from being accepted. These aren't so much the distinctives of being an Independent Fundamental Baptist. But they're close. &nbsp;Here is what I've written so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Reasons I Could Never Be Mainline" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/reasons-i-could-never-be-mainline/">introduction</a></li>
<li><a title="Reasons I Could Never Be Mainstream: Separation" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/reasons-i-could-never-be-mainline-separation/">Separation</a></li><br />

<h2>I think that pop music is inappropriate for church.</h2><br />
Yesterday I posted the first reason I would not be welcome outside of fundamentalism: <a title="Reasons I Could Never Be Mainstream: Separation" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/reasons-i-could-never-be-mainline-separation/">Ecclesiastical and personal separation</a>.</p>
<p>My second is similar to, but not exactly the same, as personal separation: I do not think that pop music is appropriate for church.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/music.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-855" alt="music" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/03/music-300x150.jpg" width="300" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m not against <em>contemporary</em> music.</strong> There are a lot of songs that have been written in my lifetime that I am very grateful for. My favorite song, <em>&ldquo;Before the Throne of God Above&rdquo;</em>, which we sing in our church quite often, was written in the 1800s and retuned about twenty years ago. I picked our current church hymnal (<em>Rejoice Hymns</em> from Majesty Music) mainly because it included songs like that (as well as modern hymns by people like Keith Getty and Chris Anderson). So I&rsquo;m not going to blanketly blast contemporary music. Regardless of this, I do believe strongly that pop music is inappropriate for church.</p>
<p>Some people will say, music is amoral. Music is neutral. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what type of music I use as long as the words and the message is right. I normally try to be nice on this blog, but that idea is utter hogwash. No one really believes it. &nbsp;(Accept maybe those in the Christian Pop apologetics ministry.)&nbsp;Secular psychologists and psychiatrists think it's&nbsp;ridiculous.</p>
<p>No one would want the local Kiss cover band playing their usual numbers - sans the words - while a bride walks down the aisle. Nobody would invite the Monkeys or the Partridge Family to play their happy-go-lucky ditties at their grandma&rsquo;s funeral. Music, even music without words, communicates. Some music is totally inappropriate in some contexts.</p>
<p>[quote style="boxed" float="left"]The new rock music is intended to broaden the generation gap, alienate parents from their children, and prepare young people for revolution. -- Paul Kanter from Jefferson Airplane.[/quote]</p>
<p>Modern pop music was created to communicate the rebellion of the 1960s and 70s. I didn&rsquo;t make that up. It&rsquo;s a well documented fact. Quotes abound backing up that statement from such distinguished <em>traditional music advocates</em> as Rolling Stone magazine and Bono. Just look for them.</p>
<p>So is a musical genre created for the purpose of inciting generational rebellion, heightening sex drive, and driving a wedge between people and anything traditional really appropriate for the worship of a God who has stated opposition to all of those causes? Is that what Paul was talking about when he said <em>&ldquo;songs, and hymns and spiritual songs?&rdquo;</em> I don&rsquo;t believe it is.</p>
<p>[quote style="boxed"]It's part of the official rock video worldview...that your parents are creeps, teachers are nerds and idiots, authority figures are laughable, nobody can really understand kids besides the corporate sponsor. -- David Kupelian, NYU [/quote]</p>
<p>Few outside of fundamentalism preach and teach this anymore. Even conservative evangelicals like John Piper, John MacArthur, and Mark Dever have opened the floodgates and allowed this music in their churches.</p>
<p>Those are flood gates I never plan to open, so I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be very welcome outside of fundamentalism.</p>
