<p>I'm sure people think its strange that I build a wood fired pizza oven in my backyard. The neighbors, fellow church members, and visiting pastors probably chuckle about it amongst themselves. "That crazy Hayden - what a waste of time and money" is what I imagine they may say behind my back.</p>
<p>Well, here is my reasoning for building a pizza oven, and how I use it for the ministry. I actually have found it incredibly useful, and if you are a pastor that's into cooking - you may find you want one too.</p>
<h2>It's a lot of fun</h2><br />
One piece of advice that my mentor gave me was that I should have a hobby that was very different from my work. Because my work mostly involves reading books, study, writing, and preaching. All things usually done in the confines of an office or church building. I wanted a hobby that took me outside, but not away from the family and I wanted a hobby with a purpose that benefited both my family and my ministry.</p>

<p>So my hobby is cooking in a wood fired oven.</p>
<p>I built my WFO myself, with a lot of help from a few of my friends in the church (thank you Matt Pullen and Todd Wright), following instructions I found on the internet. The whole thing cost me just over $1000. While it is not the best or the prettiest WFO out there by any stretch (I'm not finished with the exterior yet), it was a lot of fun to build, is a lot of fun to use, and makes amazing pizza, bread, steak and roasts.</p>
<p>For me the process of making dough, splitting fire wood, starting a fire, coaxing it into an inferno, stretching the dough into a pizza and cooking it in about 90 seconds is incredibly stress relieving. The ability to share both my hobby and what I've made with neighbors and after church visitors makes it doubly rewarding.</p>

<h2>It's fast.</h2><br />
It takes me 3 minutes to make a pizza. That time includes stretching and dressing it. Of course, I have to start a fire and make the dough and get the ingredients together. Which means I might invest an hour of my time, but I can do all of that pretty far in advance. I can come home from a church service and have the best pizza between St. Louis and Chicago on the table within five minutes for guests, and let them see it coming together. It's pretty cool.</p>

This pizza will cook in about 90 seconds.[/caption]</p>
<h2>It's cheap.</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>A 50lb bag of All Trumps flour costs $18 and makes well over 100 pizzas. (132 13" pizza to be precise)</li>
<li>A can of crushed tomatoes or tomato puree (for the sauce) costs $1.50 and makes 7-8 pizzas.</li>
<li>A block of whole milk mozzarella costs $4 and makes 7-8 pizzas.</li>
<li>Firewood at the moment is free.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Even if you add the other toppings, you are still looking at about $1-2 per pizza. I can't think of two many ways to feed 8 adults on 5 bucks, can you?</p>
<h2>It's memorable.</h2><br />
There is something about cooking pizza next to a fire that is really cool. Complete strangers who see it want to talk to me about it, want to watch, and want to taste. Then, they're usually enthusiastic about it too. Let people help out, and they are even more excited about it.</p>

<h2>It's good.</h2><br />
When I say I can make the best pizza between Chicago and St. Louis - I may sound a little cocky - but if you're not into cracker style St. Louis pizza (Imo's, Monical's or the local Villa), or Deep Dish pizza (Pizzaria Uno or it's clones) - there really isn't anywhere around here where you can get authentic Neapolitan or New York style pies. Even our lone "fancy" restaurant (the amazing Firefly Grill in Effingham) makes, in my opinion, sub par pizza in a fake wood fired oven (it's not really wood fired, just made to look like it is.)</p>
<h2>It's a nearly perfect way to express hospitality.</h2><br />
To review, I've found something I love to do, that doesn't cost a lot of money (besides the initial investment), that let's me get food on the table within minutes of a service, that people will remember and talk about, and that makes great food. It's the perfect marriage of my favorite hobby (cooking), my favorite food, the great outdoors, and ministry.</p>
<p>Do you still think I'm crazy? How about coming over sometime, sharing some pizza, and we can talk about it.</p>
