<p>[alert]This post was originally written for IFBrevolution.com[/alert]</p>
<p>I believe wholeheartedly that the time has come for Independent Baptist pastors to take a firm stand against non-biblical preaching. If I didn&rsquo;t, I wouldn&rsquo;t have started this site.</p>
<p>[well]When I use the term &ldquo;non-biblical preaching&rdquo; I am referring to preaching that does not consider the original meaning and context of a text, and thus presents a different message than God intended. I don&rsquo;t believe that the only form of biblical preaching is expository preaching (although that is what I do 95% of the time.) Topical and textual preaching can be biblical preaching as long as the preacher is careful that the Bible dictates the message.[/well]</p>
<p>Most independent Baptist preachers that I know would affirm that they are Bible preachers and they think Bible preaching is important. Most independent Baptist Bible colleges and seminaries (at least as far as I know) emphasize Bible preaching. Unfortunately, however, many of those same preachers and institutions do not consistently apply their principles when it comes to the use of their pulpits. They send mixed messages. They aren&rsquo;t really taking a stand.</p>
<p>I think that needs to change. Yesterday. Heres why:</p>
<h2 id="becausenon-biblicalpreachingisoffensivetogod.">1. Because non-biblical preaching is offensive to God.</h2><br />
Have you ever had your words taken out of context? I have, and I was far from happy about it. Imagine someone taking a snippet of one of your sermons and using it as if you endorse something that you&rsquo;ve never said. Understandably, you would be irate. Common sense and courtesy keeps us from doing that to each other.</p>
<p>But for some reason, common sense and courtesy elude us when it comes to preaching God&rsquo;s Word. Need something to lend authority to your latest tirade against the government or to get people excited about your building program - God&rsquo;s got more on the record than anyone you know, and you can always find something in there that sounds right, even if that&rsquo;s not what it meant originally. Is that how you&rsquo;d want your words handled?</p>

<p>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.</p>
<h2 id="becausenon-biblicalpreachingrobsgodspeople.">2. Because non-biblical preaching robs God&rsquo;s people.</h2><br />
When someone take God&rsquo;s words out of context, not only are they being rude in the way they handle God&rsquo;s word, but they are necessarily taking pulpit time away from what He actually said. God has given His Word for the health of the church - <em>&ldquo;that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.&rdquo;</em> Your church people don&rsquo;t need your latest idea, with a little bit of Bible pried from it&rsquo;s context sprinkled on like salt on french fries, they need God&rsquo;s Word. They need &ldquo;all scripture.&rdquo; Every time you allow someone to preach anything but a Bible message, it&rsquo;s like allowing your brother to give your kids Kit-Kats for dinner. Your church is not getting the nutrients they need, and it&rsquo;s probably going to have adverse effects on them.</p>
<h2 id="becauseallowingnon-biblicalpreachingputsindependentbaptistsintheprecarioussituationofhavingaweakerstanceonscripturethanevangelicals.">3. Because allowing non-biblical preaching puts Independent Baptists in the precarious situation of having a weaker stance on scripture than evangelicals.</h2><br />
Have you ever listened to a message by John MacArthur, Mark Dever, John Piper, Albert Mohler, Carl Trueman or David Jeremiah? Those men are all leaders in evangelicalism, and they are dead serious about fidelity to their Bible (although we would disagree on some of their applications or on the version they use.) Even Mark Driscoll (who I personally think is one of the most dangerous preachers in America) takes a very serious approach toward being a Bible preacher (if he takes a serious approach to nothing else.)</p>
<p>When you get up in your pulpit or behind a classroom lectern and say that evangelicals are compromisers who don&rsquo;t preach the Bible, and then go into the pulpit and preach a message on dress standards from Nehemiah, what kind of message are you sending? What do you think is going to happen when the 19 year old in the pew hears John MacArthur when he&rsquo;s channel surfing on his car radio? Or picks up one of Carl Trueman&rsquo;s books in the local Christian bookstore?</p>
<p>I believe that one of the reasons so many young preachers are dropping their fundamentalist stance toward evangelicalism and jumping fences is because they are seeing a fundamental disconnect in what we say we believe about the Bible, and the way that we treat it. A disconnect that, ironically, isn&rsquo;t present in many evangelicals.</p>
<p>If fundamentalism is all about fidelity to the scriptures, then what could be more fundamental than handling God&rsquo;s Word right in the pulpit?</p>
<p>Take a consistent stand against unbiblical preaching - not just because you are trying to slow the bleeding out of young fundamentalists - but because your church needs it and God&rsquo;s Word demands it.</p>
