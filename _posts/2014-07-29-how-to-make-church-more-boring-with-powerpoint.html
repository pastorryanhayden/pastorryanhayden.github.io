<p>Yesterday, I started a series on <a title="How To Use PowerPoint In Church" href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/how-to-use-powerpoint-in-church/">PowerPoint in church</a>. Without rehashing everything I said yesterday, I want to say - I&rsquo;m a fan. I think it can be a good thing and greatly improve your church&rsquo;s announcements and help people to follow the sermon.</p>
<p>But as much as I love PowerPoint. I also hate it.</p>
<p>Yes,. <em>Hate.</em> I meant what I said.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1929" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/boredom.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1929 size-medium" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/boredom-300x200.jpg" alt="boredom" width="300" height="200" /></a> 75% of the unbearably boring sermons or lectures I've heard involved PowerPoint.[/caption]</p>
<p>You see, <strong>if I had to list the four most boring speeches/lectures/sermons I&rsquo;ve ever heard at least three of them had corresponding PowerPoint slides</strong>. I&rsquo;m talking sitting in a seat poking myself with straight pins because the pain takes my mind off of the boredom boring. I&rsquo;m talking about daydreaming about going to the dentist boring. PowerPoint made these already painful sermons or lectures worse.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some people think that PowerPoint is a magic bullet that can automatically make their sermon or lecture more interesting. The truth is, PowerPoint is a magic bullet that, when shot out of the wrong gun (or sermon or lecture) kills people with boredom.</blockquote><br />
So, having established the fact that PowerPoint can kill your sermon or lesson, let me tell you how <strong>exactly how to be an evil PowerPoint user</strong>. If you do the five things below, PowerPoint will make your sermon exponentially more boring:</p>
<h3>1. Give people an outline with no real point.</h3><br />
You know what I&rsquo;m talking about. The guy who doesn&rsquo;t really preach a sermon, he preaches an outline. He might break down a passage into alliterated points and sub-points, but his sermon has no teeth. There is no &ldquo;this is what you need to do about it&rdquo; to it. It&rsquo;s 90% classification, 10% information and 0% application.</p>
<p>If you preach that way, nothing you put on the screen is going to make your sermons more interesting.</p>
<p>When you add PowerPoint to this already toxic mix, it just goes from bad to worse. All the PowerPoint does is highlight your lack of a sermon. It puts the fact that you don&rsquo;t have a sermon up on the wall for everyone to read. It&rsquo;s a visual reminder of the sermon&rsquo;s awfulness that just intensifies the auditory boredom. If your &ldquo;sermon&rdquo; has lots of points, each point you put up on the screen is like a scratch mark on a prison wall &mdash; a visual reminder of what seems like years spent in captivity.</p>
<p>The best two pieces of PowerPoint advice I could give anyone are these. (One of them is common sense, and the second comes from Charles Spurgeon.)</p>
<blockquote><p>If you have a boring sermon, no amount of PowerPoint is going to make it cease to be a boring sermon.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The golden key to keeping people&rsquo;s attention is to say something worth hearing.&rdquo; - Spurgeon</blockquote><br />

<h3>2. Animate Everything</h3><br />
The first time I ever saw anybody use a PowerPoint presentation, I was sitting in a high school leadership conference at a camp ground in New Hampshire, probably around 1997. The speaker had a good lesson. He was interesting, funny and convicting. The PowerPoint technology was very novel and very fascinating. Yet, despite the odds stacked in it&rsquo;s favor, I distinctly remember hating it. Why? The speaker animated everything.</p>
<p>Each point flew, rotated or sparkled onto the screen. Text bounced and jiggled. I felt like I was watching someone else play the most boring video game ever invented. I felt like my brain was being assaulted. Some people really should start their PowerPoint presentations with a public safety warning for pregnant ladies and those prone to seizures.</p>
<p>Animation, like PowerPoint itself, should never be used to make things more interesting. Animation is like salt &mdash; used sparingly it can heighten a good meal (or sermon), used with a bad meal (or sermon) it can accentuate the lack of taste, used excessively in either a good or bad PowerPoint presentation and it just leaves a bad taste in people's mouth.</p>
<p>Let me make a bold statement: <strong>you probably shouldn&rsquo;t use PowerPoint animation at all</strong>. None. Zero. Nadda. Just pretend the animation features in your PowerPoint software don&rsquo;t exist. Learn to think of your slides as a 21st century slide projector, displaying one still image after another in progression.</p>
<p>After a very long time using zero animation, you might loosen up and occasionally use JUST THESE animations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appear</strong> &mdash; as much as possible, try having things on separate slides instead of using appear.</li>
<li><strong>Dissolve</strong> &mdash; occasionally you&rsquo;ll want a smoother, less jolting, transition than appear.</li>
<li><strong>Wipe</strong> &mdash; but never with text. Use this to make lines look like they are being drawn as people watch them.</li>
<li><strong>Push</strong> &mdash; this is a slide transition that you can use to give the impression that the camera is panning over a landscape.</li><br />
</ul><br />
The rest of the animations: zoom, drop, fly in, move in, sparkle, fire, etc., should be avoided (unless you are trying to look cheesy and unprofessional, in which case you should use as many as possible).</p>
<p><em>For a great example of how to use animation well, check out the video below from Duarte Design. Notice that every animation has a purpose and helps to communicate something. &nbsp;This takes skill most people don't have.</em></p>

<p>A third way to be an evil PowerPoint user is:</p>
<h3>3. Use bullets excessively.</h3><br />
When you ask people to think about PowerPoint, they probably think about endless slides of bulleted sentences adorned in 90&rsquo;s looking corporate templates. I don&rsquo;t fault most users for this. After all, when you first open PowerPoint, you are greeted with a list of 90s looking corporate templates and a title slide with bullets on it.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1927" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/anti-gun-button.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1927" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/anti-gun-button-300x300.jpg" alt="anti-gun pin." width="300" height="300" /></a> Guns don't kill people. PowerPoint bullets do.[/caption]</p>
<p>Bullets are boring. (Unless they are real bullets, then they are anything but boring.) Researchers have found that bulleted lists are one of the worst ways of conveying information. Not only do people find them boring, but they have a hard time remembering anything that comes to the right of a little black circle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say you should never use bullets, they have their time and place. I&rsquo;m saying you should use bullet points sparingly. One simple thing to help you avoid the overuse of bullet points is to always start with a blank slide and ignore the bullet heavy templates Microsoft provides for you.</p>
<h2>4. Put too much on one slide.</h2><br />
One of the most boring lectures I ever sat through involved PowerPoint. The presenter of said lecture put every word he was saying on the slides. Each slide contained a paragraph with at least 60 words on it.</p>
<p>There are lots of problems with this but the main one was I could read the slide faster than he was speaking, and so I spent a minute or two of each slide thinking &ldquo;could you just move on already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1928" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/eat-mor-chikin.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1928" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/eat-mor-chikin-300x143.jpg" alt="billboard" width="300" height="143" /></a> Slides are like billboards, not documents. They should say one thing.[/caption]</p>
<p>Slides are not documents. They have more in common with billboards, meant to be read while driving 70 MPH on the interstate than they do memos that are meant to be read with a team of lawyer/interpreters around a conference room table with coffee and donuts. At some point a slide ceases to be a slide and becomes a slideument &mdash; a hybrid monster with none of the benefits of a slide and none of the benefits of a document.</p>
<p>I have three general rules to keep me from making slideuments.</p>
<h4>Rule 1: If it wouldn&rsquo;t fit in a tweet, it shouldn&rsquo;t go on a slide.</h4><br />
Seriously. 140 characters or less. Keep you slides simple, short, and to the point. In many cases, 140 characters is way too long. Very rarely should slides go beyond that.</p>
<h4>Rule 2: Keep your fonts point set at twice the median age of your audience.</h4><br />
So if the average age of your audience is 25, keep the font size above 50. If the average age of your audience is 40, don&rsquo;t drop too far below 80. Usually, I never go below 50 point font on a slide and I often go above 200 points. When it comes to text on slides, bigger is almost always better.</p>
<h4>Rule 3: Make sure that each slide only makes one point.</h4><br />
Each slide should say just one thing. Remember, think billboard, not a document.</p>
<h1>5. Become PowerPoint dependent.</h1><br />
If it sounds like I&rsquo;m saying the same thing over and over again in this post, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m saying the same thing over and over again in this post &mdash; your sermon should be good without PowerPoint, or it won&rsquo;t be good with it.</p>
<p>Invariably, at some point the computer running the presentation will fail in the middle of a message, your projector will die, your remote will stop working or some other technical difficulty will ensue. If that happens, just turn the thing off and finish your sermon.</p>
<p>People should come away from your service talking about Jesus, or talking about the lesson that they learned from the word &mdash; not about the PowerPoint presentation. To ensure this never happens &mdash; you always have to be on guard against PowerPoint takeover.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>Let me give you some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NEVER make PowerPoint slides until after you&rsquo;ve written your message.</strong> This will ensure your message can stand on its own and that you aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;thinking PowerPoint&rdquo; but &ldquo;thinking sermon.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Use PowerPoint slides sparingly.</strong> I try never to have more than a dozen or so slides for a 30 minute sermon. If I&rsquo;m teaching a lesson, I may include more, but if I&rsquo;m preaching I try to use as few slides as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Use the B or W keys to silence the slides often.</strong> In both PowerPoint and Keynote, when you press the &ldquo;B&rdquo; key it turns the screen black (effectively turning it off momentarily), when you press the &ldquo;W&rdquo; key, it turns the screen turquoise. (Just seeing if you are paying attention.) This is a great way to get everyone attention off of the screen and back to the speaker.</li>
<li><strong>Have a default placeholder slide</strong>. I have a couple of attractive slides with only the Bible Baptist logo on them that are probably on the screen 80% of the service. These slides look nice, but effectively say &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing going on here, look at the pulpit.&rdquo;</li><br />
</ul><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't Be That Guy</p>
<p>Hopefully you read this and you determine you aren't going to be PowerPoint evil anymore. &nbsp;Hopefully you put your bullets away, drop most of the words of your slides, and learn to use the B key.</p>
<p><strong>My next post will be about&nbsp;alternative ways to use PowerPoint in a church context.</strong></p>
