<p>I've never heard Dr. Jack Hyles preach in person. I've listened to several of his recorded sermons, but I've never heard him preach live. (I've listened to Jack Schaap and a few other of Jack Hyles assistants, but never Hyles himself.) I've never been to First Baptist Church in Hammond, Indiana and I've never been to Hyles-Anderson college.</p>
<p>Some of my opinions of Jack Hyles have been formed through reading his books and through anecdotal stories of those I know who did know him, but for the most part, my opinions of Dr. Hyles have been formed by interaction with the hundreds of his followers I have met through the years.</p>
<p><strong>I want to stress this</strong>: some of these men have been extremely gracious guys and men who I would gladly sit under in the ministry. I regularly listen, for example, to John Wilkerson, the current pastor of First Baptist in Hammond and I know a few guys personally who are "Hyles guys" who I respect immensly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, that is not the legacy of Jack Hyles that I see perpetuated by his followers. Before I do state what I think that legacy is, let me say that I don't know Dr. Hyles was this way, this is just the impression I get from those whom he seemed to make the biggest impression on. In other words, <strong>it's not my intention to trash the legacy of Jack Hyles, it's my intention to get preachers to understand that currently, they ARE the legacy of Jack Hyles,</strong> and that that legacy doesn't look good to young preachers who never knew the man.</p>
<p>So based solely on you, most of the preachers who did know Jack Hyles, here is the picture that seems to emerge about him.</p>
<h2>1. (Based on his followers you'd think) He thought he was more important than the apostles.</h2><br />
When you read the New Testament, you see that the apostles were humble men who deflected praise and were not above criticism. The Bereans were praised because they didn't just take Paul's word, they searched the scriptures to see if the things he was saying was so. Peter didn't respond to Paul's accusations with 100% for Cephas buttons. Their attitude was "it's all about Jesus, who cares about me."</p>
<p>When I here people talk about Jack Hyles, I get the exact opposite impression. I've heard people joke about him being a part of the trinity. I've heard them say he was the greatest preacher who ever lived. I've heard them talk about giving him regular standing ovations, (and continuing the practice in their own church.) I've heard people pray to him.</p>
<p>Most of all, they seem completely unwilling to admit that he was not perfect. When any other preacher is criticized, we at least think about it. &nbsp;When Jack Hyles is criticized, people act like someone just spit on God.&nbsp;(For example, if you were to tell me that Clarence Sexton was not your favorite preacher, I'd think nothing of it. &nbsp;With most of the Hyles guys I know, if you say anybody but Jack Hyles is your favorite preacher, they think there is something wrong with you.)</p>
<p>Did Dr. Hyles encourage this? Why else would people treat him different than any other man?</p>
<h2>2. (Based on his followers you'd think) He thought it is perfectly acceptable to be extremely loose in your interpretation of the Bible.</h2><br />
I've heard a lot of "put your Bible down and look right here" sermons, I've heard a lot of sermons where the preacher's point was obviously not the point made by the scripture and I've heard even more sermons where the preacher used the text like the national anthem at a baseball game, it got things started, but no one gave it another thought. Unfortunately, most of those sermons came from "Hyles guys."</p>
<p>Where I received ministry training, we were taught the importance of preaching the Bible in its context, and rightly dividing the Word of Truth. It was considered a shameful thing to preach a text obviously divorced from the Bible. I don't see this from the majority of Hyles people I know, they seem to have no problem whatsoever with non-biblical preaching and I can only assume Dr. Hyles himself was that way.</p>
<h2>3. (Based on his followers you'd think) He taught that people who did endeavor to teach what the Bible actually says were suspect.</h2><br />
I've heard more than one "Hyles guy" belittle expository preaching. I've heard them recount Dr. Hyles' anecdote that preaching through books of the Bible is like going through the medicine cabinet and handing people one pill after another, and I've heard them refer to men with Bible teaching ministries as "deeper lifers."</p>
<p>Based on this, what is a young pastor like myself to think other than that Dr. Hyles himself was against expositional Bible preaching.</p>
<h2>4. (Based on his followers you'd think) He taught that if you disagreed with him in any area, the gloves were off, and you are worthy of every name in the book.</h2><br />
One thing I've noticed that's peculiar to followers of Jack Hyles is that they seem to have no room for disagreement with others. You are either in their camp, or you are a "liberal" or "a neo-evangelical." I went to a very conservative, King James Only bible college that took (and still takes) a strong stand for the faith, and have been told by more than one Hyles follower that my college is liberal. I've been called a liberal or neo-evangelical many times just for writing posts like this and disagreeing with them on minor points of practice.</p>
<h2>5. (Based on his followers you'd think) He taught that the gospel was a quick sales pitch that in most cases had no effect on people's lives.</h2><br />
I've been soul-winning with Hyles guys who forced people into an involuntary sinners prayer. I've heard stories about more than one leading a non-english speaking person to the Lord who had no idea what was going on. I've heard of stories of toll-booth conversions. Most often, I've heard of soul-winning competitions and soul-winning quotas, where people were expected to win 10 people to Christ before they came back.</p>
<p>Really? Can you really not see that this is totally foreign to the New Testament?</p>
<p>Where are all these converts? Are they following Christ? Does the gospel, the power of God unto salvation, not have the power to change their lives as well? Is it possible they're are still in their&nbsp;sins, but have been inoculated by a quick prayer and a pat on the back by a person more interesting in filing out a form than seeing God change a life?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>I could list other things too, but these are the main things that me and people like me see from the followers of Jack Hyles. When we hear his name mentioned time and again, we don't think back to the glory days and the baptisms, we think of this behavior spread in hundreds if not thousands of churches all around the country.</p>
<p>We are glad for the bus ministries reaching young people. We are glad for the conservative mentality towards dress and music. We are glad for those taking a stand against theological error. All of this can be found in most if not all of followers of Jack Hyles, but unfortunately, that doesn't cancel out the negatives above. In fact, it just puts a fresh coat of paint on a building that's structurally unsound.</p>
<p>Here is the good news, the legacy of Dr. Hyles isn't written in stone yet. You are the legacy of Jack Hyles. You could stop mentioning Dr. Hyles in every sermon, stop treating him like a god, and at least be patient with those who question his legacy. You could take a strong position against preaching that twists or ignores the Bible, and commit to giving people the undiluted truth of God's word. You could be gracious and fair with those who don't see things exactly like you. You could deal with what you see as their errors, but realize that a single error does not a liberal or neo-evangelical make. You could commit to preaching Jesus as the one who came to <em>"save His people from their sins."</em> You could read and reread Romans and you could denounce manipulative soul-winning and numbers games.</p>
<p>You are the legacy of Jack Hyles. It is completely up to you.</p>
<p>I'm guessing, just based on past experience, that this won't be received well. I fully expect to be called a liberal, a neo, and a compromiser for writing this. I expect people to lambast me and say I've dragged a good man's name through the mud. If and when that happens, all you will be doing is cementing the legacy that's already forming. If you are ok with Jack Hyles being known for the things I listed above, then by all means, go for it.</p>
<p>But if you are a follower of Jack Hyles and it grieves you that you (and by extension he) is/are known for these things. <strong>Change his legacy.</strong> I triple-dog-dare you to. If you do, you will not only be improving independent Baptists as a whole, but you'll be improving the legacy of your hero.</p>
<p>Note: If you disagree with anything I've said here, and you can do so without calling people names (i.e. liberal, compromiser, etc.) or dodging the things I said above (i.e. just a "how dare you write this post), then send me a rebuttal. &nbsp;I'll publish it unedited and promise to correspond with you respectfully.</p>
