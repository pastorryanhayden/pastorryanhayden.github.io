<p>Don't try to kick them out of office</p>
<p>Don't call them names or rant on them</p>
<p>Don't blame them for all your problems</p>
<p>Don't treat them like the enemy</p>
<p>Treat them like people</p>
<p>People Christ died for</p>
<p>People being defeated by the same enemy that you are</p>
<p>You don't win people with politics</p>
<p>You don't win people with Facebook memes</p>
<p>You don't win people by calling them names</p>
<p>You don't win people with hate</p>
<p>You win people with love</p>
<p>So love them</p>
<p>Love them by walking across the room</p>
<p>Love them by sharing a meal</p>
<p>Love them by listening</p>
<p>Love them by sharing Christ with them</p>
<p>Love them still when they reject Him</p>
<p>They are not the enemy</p>
<p>They are deceived by the enemy</p>
<p>Love will help them see that</p>
<p>Stop trying to make casualties</p>
<p>Start trying to make converts</p>
<p>Everything is downstream of hearts and minds</p>
<p>So win hearts and minds</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will."</em>&nbsp;<strong>2 Timothy 2:24-26</strong></blockquote></p>
