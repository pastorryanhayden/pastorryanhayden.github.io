<p><em>I like to post my Sunday Sermon manuscripts on here. &nbsp;(Although it's been awhile.) &nbsp;These are my typed out manuscripts &nbsp;and are meant primarily for me. &nbsp;They are usually hastily written and almost never edited - so there will be some spelling and grammar mistakes - particularly with homophones. &nbsp;This sermon is part of an ongoing verse by verse study of Ephesians, and part of a sub-section series I'm calling "where the rubber meets the road." &nbsp;Here it is:</em></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take your Bible&rsquo;s with me again and turn to the book of Ephesians chapter 4. Ephesians 4. We are going to be looking at just one verse in Ephesians 4, but to get the context we&rsquo;ll go ahead and read several. So let&rsquo;s begin in verse number 21 and we&rsquo;ll go down through verse number 29.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;<a>Eph 4:21-29 KJV</a> 21 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: 22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; 23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; 24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. 25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another. 26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: 27 Neither give place to the devil. 28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with <a>his</a> hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. 29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
<strong>I&rsquo;ve been calling this little series as I preach through this passage</strong> &ldquo;Where the rubber meets the road.&rdquo; These are super practical commands about how to live as a Christian.</p>
<p>Now, and I want to be clear on this, this isn&rsquo;t about how you BECOME a Christian. You become a Christian by grace through faith. We learned that earlier in Ephesians. Salvation is a free gift that God will give to anyone, and it&rsquo;s based on what Jesus has already done - not on something that you or I do.</p>
<p>But when you become a Christian by the grace of God - you change. God changes you. That&rsquo;s part of the gift. Remember folks - we are saved from hell but that&rsquo;s secondary. The main thing we are saved from is sin. The bible says in Matthew 1:21 <em>&ldquo;For you shall call his name Jesus for He shall save his people from their sins.&rdquo;</em> So it makes sense that if we are being saved FROM sins that part of that free gift is that we are going to stop sinning.</p>
<p>When you accept Christ - you get a whole new you. The Bible says <em>&ldquo;If any man be in Christ He is a new creature, old things are passed away, behold - all things become new.&rdquo;</em> You have a new nature - a spiritual nature. You have the ability to follow and commune with God. You have changed teams.</p>
<p>There is a defensive player on the New England Patriots this year named Brandon Bowner, who played for the Seattle Seahawks last year. He even has a &ldquo;legion of boom&rdquo; tattoo. But this year in the super bowl - he&rsquo;s on the&nbsp;other team. He&rsquo;s wearing a different jersey and he&rsquo;s probably covering up that legion of boom tattoo.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Feb-1AM.001.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2131" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Feb-1AM.001-300x169.jpg" alt="Feb 1AM.001" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
<p>And that is what these verses are all about. They are saying - stop wearing the jersey of the world - the old man, and start wearing the jersey of God, the new man. Here&rsquo;s what that jersey looks like.</p>
<ul>
<li>The world lives in a world of lies - the saved man lives a life of truth and truthfulness.</li>
<li>The world has become unsensitized to what it should be angry about but get&rsquo;s very angry over selfish things. The saved man is angered by what angers God but keeps his personal anger in check.</li>
<li>The world steals - they steal time, they steal by cheating, they are prone to theft. The saved man doesn&rsquo;t take shortcuts. He&rsquo;s honest and He works hard.</li><br />
</ul><br />
There is another difference in the uniforms we are going to talk about today and it&rsquo;s found in verse 29:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
Of course, this verse is all about how we talk. What we say. Our words.</p>
<p>I think the best way to look at this this morning is to look at the way the lost world talks - we&rsquo;ll keep with the football analogy - the world&rsquo;s jersey, then we&rsquo;ll examine the saved man&rsquo;s jersey and talk about how the saved man should talk.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look first at&hellip;</p>
<h1>1. The world&rsquo;s jersey</h1><br />
If you look again at this verse it presumes that the <em>&ldquo;old man&rdquo;</em> way of doing things is what it calls <em>&ldquo;corrupt communication.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Human beings, across the board, have a problem with their tongues. They have a problem controlling what they say and who they say it too.</p>
<p>Really, it seems like there isn&rsquo;t a week that goes by when we aren&rsquo;t faced in the news with some scandal over what someone said. Donald Trump. &nbsp;Paula Deen. &nbsp;Don Imus, Jonathan Gruber. &nbsp;You go to a party and their will probably be two people in the corner having the &ldquo;did you hear what she said to me?&rdquo; conversation. Every single one of us has, at one point or another, hurt someone else by the things we said.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a theme of the scripture. In the middle of the famous Romans 3 <em>&ldquo;There is none righteous, no not one&rdquo;</em> passage it says this:</p>
<blockquote><p><a>Rom 3:13-14 KJV</a> <em>13 Their throat <a>is</a> an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps <a>is</a> under their lips: 14 Whose mouth <a>is</a> full of cursing and bitterness:</em></blockquote><br />
Now notice - it says their throat is an open sepulchre. That can mean two things - either it means their words are like death or their words kill. Then it says the poison of asps is under their lips - so their words can be like a poisonous snake bite. The last thing it says is that their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</p>
<p>None of those are flattering things.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:8 says</p>
<blockquote><p><a>Col 3:8 KJV</a> <em>8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</em></blockquote><br />
Again - you can&rsquo;t &ldquo;put something off&rdquo; unless it&rsquo;s on in the first place.</p>
<p>People have a talking problem.</p>
<p>Now, I think I have some special insight because I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time with the rawest of raw people - sixth graders. When I was a sixth grade teacher - you wouldn&rsquo;t believe how mean those kids could be to each other, the stupid things they could talk about, the lies they could tell. Sitting at a lunch table was all giggles and whispers and often their would be one kid or another that would end up in tears.</p>
<p>But do you know what? It&rsquo;s not just sixth graders. We adults - we do the same thing - we just manage to be more subtle about it. You go to a work party, or even a family get together, and their is bound to be a couple of people in the corner talking about things they probably shouldn&rsquo;t - or saying mean things about someone, or exaggerating to make themselves look good.</p>
<p>The Bible has a word for that - it&rsquo;s called corrupt communication. Rotten, dead, putrid, filthy, corrupt talking.</p>
<p>So what is this &ldquo;currupt communication&rdquo; we are supposed to put off? I think it would help us if I gave you some concrete examples.</p>
<p><strong>Anything that is foolish is corrupt.</strong> In Ephesians 5 it says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;> <a>Eph 5:4 KJV</a> </em>4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks&rdquo;.</blockquote><br />
So much of what is said is just pointless. It&rsquo;s stupid. It&rsquo;s foolish.</p>
<p>Do you know there are guys on twitter, dozens of them, that take a fake name - usually a mashup of some character from TV or a beer commercial and some preacher - and they spend their time publicly making fun of preachers. I mean, you could fill books with the stuff - it&rsquo;s foolish. It does no one any good. It&rsquo;s corrupt communication.</p>
<p>So much of what is on TV is just foolish. It&rsquo;s immature. It&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>Another category from that same verse would be&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Anything that is filthy</strong> There are things that are not appropriate topics of conversation for people. They are filthy. They deal with parts of life that shouldn&rsquo;t be on display and shouldn&rsquo;t be fodder for jokes. It&rsquo;s corrupt communication.</p>
<p><strong>Anything that is Deceitful is corrupt communication.</strong> If it isn&rsquo;t totally true - it&rsquo;s not for us to talk about. Exaggerations. Outright lies. Manipulations. That&rsquo;s all corrupt.</p>
<p>Another area of corrupt communication is&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Anything that is Bitter.</strong> We&rsquo;ll talk a little more about bitterness later, but if your words are motivated by personal anger that you refuse to forgive then they are corrupt communication.</p>
<p>Another form of corrupt communication is&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Anything that is boastful or self-serving.</strong> You&rsquo;ve probably been to some large social function before - where everyone splits up and tells stories. They are usually trying to be &ldquo;the most interesting man in the world.&rdquo; They are trying to make themselves look good - this is corrupt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say one last kind of corrupt communication is&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Anything that is questionable (rumor)</strong> Sometimes someone will say &ldquo;Well, I heard it through the grapevine that so and so&hellip;&rdquo; That&rsquo;s nothing but gossip. If you don&rsquo;t know that something is absolutely true - then don&rsquo;t say it. That&rsquo;s corrupt communication.</p>
<p>So the first thing we are told to do here is to put off this corrupt communication. Stop participating in foolish and filthy talk. Stop let ting your words show that you have hatred and wounds from a refusal to forgive. Stop passing along rumors. Stop exaggerating and trying to make yourself look good. It&rsquo;s all the jersey of the world. Put it off.</p>
<p>So how do we put on..</p>
<h1>2. The saved man&rsquo;s jersey</h1><br />
I think that our text today gives us three simple steps to acting like a Christian who has his tongue under control. Let me give them to you:</p>
<p>First&hellip;</p>
<h2>1. Stop talking so much.</h2><br />
Look at the verse again:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
The primary task of Christians who want to talk like Christians is to put a cork in it. Stop the loose talking, stop talking just to fill the space, stop the idle words.</p>
<p>At the very least, turn on your &ldquo;letter.&rdquo; You know &ldquo;Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.&rdquo; That indicates that you are thinking before you are speaking. That indicates that there is some kind of filter there.</p>
<p>Listen folks, the Bible is clear on this - we are going to give an account to God for every idle word. Turn with me to Matthew 12 for a second. Matthew 12. Listen to what Jesus said in verses 34-37&hellip;</p>
<blockquote><p><a>Mat 12:34-37 KJV</a> <em>34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. 35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. 36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. 37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</em></blockquote><br />
Listen church - if we are going to stand before God someday and answer for <em>&ldquo;every idle word.&rdquo;</em> Don&rsquo;t you think it makes sense that we think before we speak? Don&rsquo;t you think we probably are going to talk less than those whose only filter is what they can get away with?</p>
<p>So turn the filter on.</p>
<p>One year when I was in college, our choir took a trip to New York City. We travelled up their in a regular school bus. Packed in like sardines and we drove straight through. On the way up, I was sitting next to this godly black kid named Rudy. Good guy. I must have talked his ear off because about two thirds of the way up there&nbsp;he just spouted off a reference. &ldquo;Proverbs 29:11&rdquo; I said &ldquo;What?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Proverbs 29:11.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s all he&rsquo;d say - so I took out my pocket bible - this was before smart phones and I looked it up. Here is what that verse says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
Let&rsquo;s not be fools. Let&rsquo;s not wear the world&rsquo;s jersey.</p>
<p>The second step to talking like a Christian is&hellip;</p>
<h1>2. Talk when it is needed to build people up.</h1><br />
Our text says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying,&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
A whole lot of the time - we should just be quiet - but sometimes we need to speak up. When we have the opportunity to edify people - we should take it.</p>
<p>What does it mean to edify? I mean, that&rsquo;s not a word you use very often. Edify is a word that means &ldquo;to build up.&rdquo; We sometimes call a building an &ldquo;edifice.&rdquo; Edify - to build up.</p>
<p>You have the opportunity to build up people with your words. You have the opportunity to point them to Christ.</p>
<p>By the way, both lost people and saved people need pointing to Christ. Lost people need to be pointed to Him as a savior, but we need to be pointed to Him as our example and Lord and helper.</p>
<p>Every word that comes out of your mouth can either be like another 2x4 to build people up - or a rock to tear people down. As a Christian, you&rsquo;ve got to be intentional about building people up.</p>
<p>Sometimes that means encouraging people. Sometimes that means gently correcting people. Sometimes that means just being there. But the intention is important - the intention must be to build them up - to edify them.</p>
<p>One more look at our text:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
The third thing we should do is&hellip;</p>
<h1>3. Talk to minister grace.</h1><br />
You are God&rsquo;s minister. Let me say that again - you are God&rsquo;s minister. I&rsquo;m not the only minister in this church. Every Christian is supposed to be a minister - every one of us is supposed to have a ministry and even if we don&rsquo;t have an official ministry - we have what the New Testament calls <em>&ldquo;the ministry of reconciliation.&rdquo;</em> We have the ministry of being an ambassador for Christ. We get to represent God&rsquo;s heart to mankind.</p>
<p>We get to minister Grace. We can do that by sharing the gospel and we should. We should tell others about Jesus Christ. But we can also do that by speaking the kind of words that Jesus would speak.</p>
<p>Colossians 4:6 says this:</p>
<blockquote><p><a>Col 4:6 KJV</a> <em>6 Let your speech <a>be</a> alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.</em></blockquote><br />
Listen folks - we need to always be conscious of the fact that we are ambassadors for Christ and that our words should show the grace of God.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you are out and the lady at Wendy&rsquo;s get&rsquo;s your order wrong - remember you are a minister of grace and an ambassador for Christ.</li>
<li>When you are online and someone says something you think is totally stupid - remember you are a minister of grace and an ambassador for Christ.</li>
<li>When the telemarketer calls - try to screen it and not answer in the first place - but if you do - remember you are a minister of grace and an ambassador for Christ.</li>
<li>When you children or your spouse does something that gets on your nerves, remember you are a minister of grace and an ambassador for Christ.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Here is what it comes down to folks - before, before you trusted Christ - when you had on that other teams jersey - your talk, your speech, was always about you and serving you. It was selfish. It was self-serving. If it was fun. If it made you look good. If you could get away with it. You said it.</p>
<p>But now you&rsquo;ve put on another jersey and you need to realize that every word - every word - whether it&rsquo;s a word about the meat loaf or a word about the savior - is supposed to represent Jesus. Every word is an opportunity to show God&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>I want to close by going to a familiar passage. Turn with me to James 3.</p>
<p>James 3 is all about this matter of the tongue, and we aren&rsquo;t going to take the time to read it all, but I want you to notice verse 2</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;&rdquo;For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</em></blockquote><br />
If you can get this matter of your tongue under control - you can get the rest of your life under control.</p>
<p>How about it folks? Do you have your tongue under control? Are you using corrupt speech? Are you steering your tongue towards edifying.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stand together for prayer.</p>
