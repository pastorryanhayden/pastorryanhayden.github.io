<p>A few days ago, I posted an article about why Christians shouldn't adopt abusive terms for unbelievers. For the most part, it seemed to be pretty well accepted, the only pushback I got was in including the word "sodomite" as an abusive term for homosexuals.</p>
<p>The word "sodomite" or "sodomites" does occur five times in the Old Testament, but I believe firmly it that it is not necessarily a term for homosexuals and shouldn't be used that way today. Why?</p>
<h1>Reason 1 - the definition of the word</h1><br />
Strong's dictionary defines "Sodomite" as "a male temple prostitute." According to Strong's the word does not <em>necessarily</em> refer to homosexuality, but to the practice of male prostitution. &nbsp;When you consider the next two reasons, it's easy to see why.</p>
<h1>Reason 2 - the use of the word</h1><br />
If you look closely at the five times "sodomite" is used in the King James, it's pretty easy to see from the context that the word is referring to the kind of ritual prostitution that was common with ancient pagans. Did that prostitution include homosexuality? Absolutely. Does that mean that's always or even usually what the word means? That's quite a stretch.</p>
<h1>Reason 3 - the word itself</h1></p>
<ul>
<li>The Hebrew word translated "sodomite" in the KJV is transliterated "<em>qĕdesh.</em>" (Source <a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H6945&amp;t=KJV">here</a>.)</li>
<li>The Hebrew word for a female prostitute in the KJV is transliterated "<em>qĕdeshah</em>." (Source <a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H6948&amp;t=KJV">here</a>.)</li>
<li>The Hebrew word for Sodom is transliterated "<em>Cĕdom</em>" (Which is pretty close to our English "Sodom" and really far from "<em>qĕdesh.</em>") (Source <a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H5467&amp;t=KJV">here</a>)</li><br />
</ul><br />
<em>So is it a translation mistake to use the word "sodomite?" </em> I wouldn't go that far, it's probable that the KJV translators thought the main sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was the kind of religious prostitution that was so prominent in ancient religion (even in the New Testament - example - Temple at Corinth.) It's not much of a stretch to think of that religion spilling over into the kind of actions you see with Lot, the angels and the men of Sodom.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1><br />
I'm all for using Bible words. I get that. I know that there has been some confusion about this particular word, but I would say, with just this short but obvious word study, that when you use "sodomite" as a loaded insult for homosexuality, you aren't standing on solid Bible ground. In the New Testament, in the context of the gospel, Paul used different a different kind of language and used it in concert with other sins. I'd also say you should examine your reasons for <em>wanting</em> to use it, considering all of the things <a title="Why I Won&rsquo;t Call Lost People Names" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wont-call-lost-people-names/">I said in my last post</a>.</p>
