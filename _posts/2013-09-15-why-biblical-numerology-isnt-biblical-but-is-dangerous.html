<p>Recently, I've noticed what seems to be a revival of interest in "Biblical Numerology." For the most part, it seems this is being championed by extreme King James Only proponents as "proof" that the King James is double inspired. (While I am King James only, I reject the notion that it is double inspired for a number of reasons.) The basic idea is this: God has invested numbers with a certain significance (i.e. 7 stands for completion) and that you can look through the King James Bible and find patterns of these numbers. The preachers of this theory either point to the verse numbers, to the number of letters in a word, to the amount of times a word is found in the King James, and even to the divisibility of numbers obtained by any of the ways above and they say that this is proof that the King James is the final authority.</p>
<p>I believe strongly that this is a heresy and that it needs to be contended against as much as we see it. Here are five reasons why:</p>
<h2>1. Numerology is not taught in scripture.</h2><br />
You cannot find a single passage of scripture where numerology is taught or commended. (On the contrary, divination, of which numerology is a part, is always condemned in scripture.) You may be able to find lots of verses with numbers in them. Those numbers may seem to be a pattern, but nowhere are we taught to look for systems of numbers in the scripture much less told what those numbers signify.</p>
<p>The Bible is supposed to be authoritative. Yet, when you start looking for numerical patterns, the best you are doing is guessing. Rather than add to the authority of scripture, you are spending your study time chasing rabbits that in the long run, have no biblical authority.</p>
<p><em>Update: The only place I can find in scripture where there may be legitimate numerology in play is the mark of the beast in Revelation. &nbsp;But one passage does not give you license to go to seed on numerology. &nbsp;It's still not taught or commended anywhere in scripture.</em></p>
<p>On a similar note...</p>
<h2>2. Numerology sets up a preacher as a "Bible Study Wizard"</h2><br />
Extreme King James Only advocates are quick to mock those who take the Received Text position, saying that we believe you have to know Greek and Hebrew to have the Word of God. They say that we are stealing the authority away from the text and putting it in ourselves as "Bible Scholars."</p>
<p>Ironically, these are the same guys who are peddling books about numerology. How do they find these patterns? Who gets to say which numbers stand for what? Where does all of this come from? Ultimately, it comes from a preacher's imagination. You have to just take His word for it. So the same crowd that mocks and belittles the study of biblical languages because it sets up a "Catholic" division between preachers and people is making pope like pronouncements about "Bible Codes" that have been lost on all of us laymen since the first century.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<h2>3. Numerology becomes a replacement for what the Bible actually says.</h2><br />
There are 66 books in the Bible. These are the "all scripture" that is "profitable" and makes us "throughly furnished unto all good works." It would take a lifetime to cover those 66 books, and even then not thoroughly. I've been preaching through the book of Matthew once a week since November 2011 and I'm on chapter 19. I've got my hands full just trying to study and explain what the Bible plainly says.</p>
<p>So why should I waste people's time getting them looking for patterns that supposedly exist below the surface? The surface is complicated enough! Ultimately, numerology is a diversion that takes the authority from what the Bible says and puts it on a preacher.</p>
<h2>4. Numerologists can find whatever they want in the Bible.</h2><br />
If you look at clouds long enough, they'll start to look like lions, or elephants, or pizza or the new Ford F-150. If you look at a page full of polka dots long enough, you'll see patterns there. You can make whatever patterns you want.</p>
<p>The Bible is a long book. In it are millions of words and letters, and thousands of verses and chapters. When you start adding up letters and dividing verse numbers of course you are going to find patterns. Just like you'd find patterns in the dictionary or encyclopedia or any other really long book if you looked hard enough.</p>
<p>When you move into numerology you stop being an honest student of scripture and move into the realm of conspiracy theory. You become a diviner - looking for meaning in omens. You believe what you want to believe and the only thing it nets you is the disdain of others.</p>
<h2>5. Numerology is not necessary to prove that God's word is inspired.</h2><br />
You don't need numerology to prove that God's Word is inspired. All you need is God's Word. Fulfilled prophecy, historical accuracy, and longevity would all be more helpful than numerology - but even these are unnecessary. The biggest evidence that God's Word is breathed out by God is the fact that God's Word breathes life into those who hear it. God's Word converts the soul, makes wise the simple, and enlightens the eyes (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Psalm19" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Psalm 19</a>). I know of no other book that does that.</p>
<p>When the extreme KJVo proponents run to numerology (or turn to meanness, which is even more common) to gain respect for their position - they gain nothing besides making their position less believable.</p>
