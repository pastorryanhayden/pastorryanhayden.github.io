<p>Teenagers (and adults who act like them) sometimes say some pretty dumb things. Sometimes, a teenager will say something nasty, cruel or hateful and you'll have to correct them. One or two of the times this has happened to me, I've been met with the foolproof, rock solid, intellectually unscalable response <strong>"it's a free country man."</strong></p>
<p><em>I'm sorry. I must have forgot that it's a free country. I must have forgot that we have freedom of speech here in America. You know, because everything that isn't illegal is thus automatically a good idea. Try these: It's not illegal to jump off a cliff. It's not illegal to eat only eggplant for the rest of your life. It's not illegal to add the word "jellyfish" to every sentence you say from now on. It's a free country man, go for it.</em></p>
<p>When we get on to kids about bad speech, we aren't appealing to legality, we are appealing to higher motives than that: kindness, their Christian walk, their personal testimony, etc.</p>
<p>In Christianity, there seems to be a lot of people who are pulling the "it's a free country man" card quite often. Of course I'm speaking about the tired old arguments about Christian liberty.</p>
<p>I believe in Christian liberty. I believe that if a behavior isn't specifically condemned or commended in scripture, that we need to give people some serious slack. There are people who hold wildly different opinions about areas of Christian practice than me that I think Christian liberty demands we give slack to. For example, I would have a problem with Charles Spurgeon's view of alcohol. Spurgeon would take issue with my piano. I think that if a person loves God and is faithfully trying to live by the Word, then we have to give room for difference of opinion in areas of practice.</p>
<p>That being said, there is a difference between believing in Christian liberty and thinking that it is always wise and proper to use it. Just because the Bible doesn't condemn something specifically, doesn't mean a Christian should do it. We live above the level of what is lawful. There are far higher motivations for the Christian than mere legality.</p>
<p>Our walk with God, our testimony to the lost, charity towards are fellow believers, and usefulness to the church; these are all motivations that the Bible says trump our liberty. (They also cut just as deeply into those who are overzealous about law as those who are overzealous about liberty.)</p>
<p>"It's a free country man." Let's use our freedom for the glory of God and build up the kingdom of God.</p>
