<p>Last night I did it again - after months of being a good boy on the internet, I set off a Twitter war. Here is what I posted:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Everything God created is good. There is no thing: pigs, alchohol or anything else that is inherently evil. There are things that are abused</p>
<p>&mdash; Ryan Hayden (@rynhayden) <a href="https://twitter.com/rynhayden/status/517116863336046593">October 1, 2014</a></blockquote><br />
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>and then, for clarification, I added this:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>
In case you are wondering, I do think that God intended other things for alcohol than purposely embibing yourself.</p>
<p>&mdash; Ryan Hayden (@rynhayden) <a href="https://twitter.com/rynhayden/status/517117901170417664">October 1, 2014</a><br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>(Yes, I know, spelling errors.)</p>
<p>So what was I getting at? Let me tell you what I was thinking and try to explain myself. Last week, I preached from 1 Timothy 4:1-4, the passage where Paul warns Timothy that end times preachers will be <em>"Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats..."</em></p>
<p>Now, most commentators agree that this is referring to asceticism and gnostic dualism. The idea that it is somehow spiritually evil to partake in physical enjoyment like sex (in marriage) and a good meal (meats.) This prophecy was already coming true in Timothy's day, but really came to full fruition in the early middle ages in Roman Catholicism. (Ever wonder why priests don't marry or why monks live in poverty and isolation?)</p>
<p>To cap it all off - Paul made this definitive statement in verses 4-5:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer."</em></blockquote><br />
Now, yesterday morning, I read an article on Facebook about a young family who were kicked off the bus in England because they were trying to get their baby to stop crying by singing the song "Peppa Pig." (For those of you don't know, Peppa Pig is a harmless TV show for toddlers about a family of pigs.) A muslim woman on the bus took offense to them singing openly about pigs and demanded that they be removed from the bus for their insensitivity. This got me thinking about how Christianity is a religion that really affirms the goodness of God's creation. So I posted those tweets thinking about Islam's warped sense of creation.</p>
<p>But of course, people took offense to my statement, especially the alcohol part. I think mainly because they aren't used to hearing such things. So here is my attempt at a clarification:</p>
<p><strong>First, there is a difference in the terms inherently evil, corrupted, and abused.</strong> I do not think creation is <strong>inherently evil</strong>. In fact, I think teaching that creation is inherently evil is what 1 Timothy 4 calls a <em>"doctrine of devils."</em> Creation is good. When God was finished with it, He called it good. So everything that is part of God's creation is not inherently evil.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn't mean that it cannot be <strong>corrupted</strong>. For example, the Bible teaches that we are corrupted in our sin. The Bible teaches that the ground was cursed after the fall. Obviously, Satan and his angels, who were once trophies of God's creation, have been corrupted. I'm not precluding the possibility that creation can <em>become</em> evil because of the fall.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that creation, when it is used for the purposes God <em>originally intended</em>, is not evil. God intended sex for enjoyment inside of the bonds of marriage. That's not evil. God intended food to be enjoyed and even our Lord Jesus Christ enjoyed food. That's not evil. You could argue that God created humans with a capacity to enjoy sports, laughter, stories, etc.. Those things are not inherently evil.</p>
<p>But now we come to the third term: <strong>abused</strong>. God's creation can be abused. When two unmarried people have sex - that's an abuse of the creation of sex. When a man voyeuristicly enjoys pornography, that's an abuse of God's intention of beauty. When a person eats food that God intended for nourishment to the point where it harms him, then that's a abuse of God's intention for food. I would say, when a person drink's alcohol to purposely inebriate himself, that's an abuse of alcohol.</p>
<p>Enter this tweet:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>We have to guard against the temptation to call God's good creation evil just because others are abusing it.</p>
<p>&mdash; Ryan Hayden (@rynhayden) <a href="https://twitter.com/rynhayden/status/517117162935177218">October 1, 2014</a></blockquote><br />

<p>This is where I think Christians need to be careful.</p>
<p>We have a tendency to call something evil just because the world abuses it. I do it. You do it. When my preschool aged children ask why we never go down the liquor aisle at Walmart, I just tell them "it's naughty." That's way easier than explaining this:</p>
<p>Liquor is abused by so many people. Some people who I counsel. We know of lives destroyed by it's abuse. But does that make it inherently evil? Is alcohol inherently bad?</p>
<p>Consider this:<br />
* Alcohol is in bread. It's what causes bread to rise.<br />
* Alcohol was used as a water purifier for centuries. Until recently, most of the people in the world didn't have fresh water to drink, so they would put a small amount of wine in their drinking water to kill off the harmful bacteria in it.<br />
* Alcohol was for many years used as a medicine.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not saying this as a justification for modern day americans to drink alcoholic beverages. I'm saying that we should be careful in calling God's creation evil. It's not evil as long as it is used for it's intended purposes. It becomes evil when it is abused. Would you fault someone in a foreign, third world country for taking strong drink as a narcotic when nothing better was available? Did they just do something evil? If so, what's the difference between that and morphine, another substance that is abused by many people?</p>
<p>Now, I'm what you call a teetotaler. I do not drink alcoholic beverages of any kind. In our church, that is a requirement for leadership. How can I justify that if alcohol is not inherently evil? Here is how?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bible repeatedly warns against drunkenness and the deceptiveness of strong drink.</li>
<li>Drinking in our culture is tied to things that are evil - the party lifestyle, the bar scene, etc.</li>
<li>There is no need for alcohol in 21st century america. We don't need it as a water purifier and we don't need it as a medicine. We have better stuff available.</li><br />
</ul><br />
So if it's something that scripture warns against, it's something that could hurt our testimony, and it's something that really has few redeeming uses in our age, it's my personal opinion that Christians should stay away from it.</p>
<p>But as with everything else, we need to be careful in the way that we talk about it. There are Christians who won't cook with vinegar or take Nyquil. That type of overreaction doesn't help Christianity at all. It just adds chains to people God never intended for them to have and it denies the goodness of God's creation.</p>
<p>We do it in other areas too. How many Christians have to fight the thought that anything related to sex is evil when the Bible clearly says its not?</p>
<p>We don't do God any favors when we take a "stronger" position than scripture. I would argue that it is just as harmful, and maybe even more harmful then when we take a "weaker" position than scripture. We misrepresent God and we misrepresent God's creation. If we aren't careful, we can produce a generation of Christians that think God's ultimate aim is their enjoyment or we can produce a generation of Christians who think God is anti-enjoyment. How we represent God's creation can have catastrophic effects on our witness.</p>
