<h2>A Familiar Story</h2><br />
Last week, I had lunch (wood oven pizza!) with a friend in New England. This guy is a gracious, passionate, and committed Christian. He drives over forty-five minutes, three times a week to go to an independent Baptist church. He's the kind of guy who any pastor would love to have in their church. He's also an accomplished scientist. In short, he's a great source of conversation and fellowship.</p>
<p>He told me a story over lunch that I've heard variations of several times before. He told me about going soul winning with his pastor (not his current pastor) and the pastor went up to a foreign man who obviously couldn't speak very much English. He went up to Him and said "Would you like to go to heaven when you die?" The man just kind of grunted. Then the pastor said "pray this prayer after me." Grabbed the man's hand, bowed his head and started praying a sinners prayer.</p>
<p>My friend, the witness of all of this, opened his eyes during the prayer to survey the situation. Neither of the two men had their eyes closed. They were both looking at each other with with obvious "can you believe this guy?" smirks on their faces. In all probability, they didn't have enough of a grasp of English to understand anything the pastor was saying.</p>
<p>When the pastor was finished praying, he opened his eyes looked at the guys and said "Great! You're saved now. I'll see you in heaven. Don't let anyone tell you different." and walked away.</p>
<p>My friend said that at that moment, he realized there was something completely off about the whole thing.</p>
<h2>A Flawed Methodology</h2><br />
I've experienced similar situations many times. Often, the soul-winner who did it came back to a meeting excited to tell people that fifteen people were saved while he was visiting. I've heard variations of the same story from many people. The common denominator's are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a presentation focused on heaven and hell</li>
<li>very little time spent</li>
<li>a high pressure "pray this prayer after me" approach</li>
<li>an insistence on immediate assurance of salvation</li><br />
</ul><br />
I like to call it the "one, two, three pray with me" approach, and I've come to view it as completely unbiblical, totally heretical and as dangerous as poison. There are tens of thousands of people in jails, brothels, bars and churches who have a false sense of <strong>assurance</strong> because they "prayed the prayer" but have as much <strong>understanding</strong> of salvation as my left shoe.</p>
<h2>A Hollow Defense</h2><br />
The proponents of this method will usually go to the story of the Philippian jailor in Acts and say "All Paul said was <em>'believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved'</em>." and say "See! Salvation is simple."</p>
<p>But think about it? To a first century hearer, like the jailor, each of the words "believe" "on" "Lord" "Jesus" and "Christ" would be loaded with meaning.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"Believe on"</em> itself is misunderstood, and certainly meant more, not less, than it does today.</li>
<li><em>"Lord"</em> meant recognizing Jesus as the authority.</li>
<li>"Jesus" was a common Jewish name that signified salvation.</li>
<li><em>"Christ"</em> was a messianic term, and meant recognizing Jesus as the heir of the Old Testament prophecies. (Which meant believing the Old Testament prophecies.)</li><br />
</ul><br />
It would be hard to come up with four more loaded terms. Personally, I think that Paul had either already explained this to the jailor, or took time to do it afterwards.</p>
<p>With that passage out of the way, they'll run to <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Romans10%3A9-10" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Romans 10:9-10</a>. But that passage, when you actually think about it, gives the same problems as the one in Acts.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</em>"</blockquote><br />
Just like Acts, this verse presupposed an understanding of Christ as the Lord whose come to save(<em>the Lord Jesus</em>). But this verse actually adds to <em>"Believe"</em> the word <em>"confess."</em> Words mean something. "Confess" means "to say the same thing." These verses do NOT support the 1-2-3-P-A-M methodology any more than the Acts passage. They actually destroy it.</p>
<h2>A Simple Solution</h2><br />
So how are we to present salvation to a lost world? Obviously we should be evangelizing. We are commanded to preach the gospel to every creature. We are commanded to make disciples of all nations. We can't use the <strong>bad</strong> methodology of others as an excuse to have <strong>no</strong> methodology ourselves.</p>
<p>I think the heart of the confusion is how salvation is presented in the first place. One of the hallmarks of the 1-2-3-P-A-M methodology is a focus on heaven and hell. But you'd be hard pressed to find many examples of men in the Bible going up to strangers and asking them "Do you want to go to heaven when you die?"</p>
<p>The apostles took a totally different tact.</p>
<p>Almost exclusively, whenever you see people present salvation in the Bible, they present salvation as being saved <strong>from sins</strong>. When the apostles gave their testimony, they presented themselves as rebels against God whom God turned around through the power of the gospel. When you read the salvation passages (like Romans) in context, you'll see the theme of it is salvation from sins. Even the very first mention of Christ in the New Testament - <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Matthew1%3A21" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Matthew 1:21</a> - says <em>"And thou shalt call his name Jesus - for He shall save His people from their sins."</em></p>
<p>Biblical salvation is salvation <em>"from sins."</em> Heaven and hell are byproducts.</p>
<h2>A Huge Difference</h2><br />
And here is where the 1-2-3-P-A-M methodology falls apart.</p>
<p><strong>Everybody wants to go to heaven when they die.</strong> <em>Very few people are interested in a Savior from their sins.</em> You aren't even interested in a savior from your sins unless you see your sins as something bad. Most people aren't even there yet. (The jews at Pentecost were - but that's another blog post.) You aren't going to go out on the street (at least in the states) and have dozens of salvations to report.</p>
<p>But you also aren't going to go out and mislead simple minded people into thinking they have something that they don't have. You aren't going to go out and preach a message of salvation almost totally foreign to the New Testament. You aren't going to choke on or explain away the numerous New Testament passages that speak about repentance or about Christians being fundamentally different from the unsaved.</p>
<p>The <em>"from sins"</em> thing is a subtle difference, but it has huge implications in practice. In reality, it's the difference between biblical salvation and a counterfeit, between making disciples and making false converts, and between helping people with their deepest need and helping yourself look good with your preacher friends.</p>
