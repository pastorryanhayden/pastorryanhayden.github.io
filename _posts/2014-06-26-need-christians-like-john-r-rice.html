<p>I&rsquo;m a John R. Rice fan. I don&rsquo;t agree with everything he wrote and did, but the more I learn about him, the more he has become one of my heroes.</p>
<p>As I was cleaning up the church library today, I saw a book written by Rice I&rsquo;d never seen before entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Earnestly-contending-faith-John-Rice/dp/B0007EQZ1M/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403808296&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=earnestly+contending+for+the+faith"><em>&ldquo;Earnestly Contending for the Faith&rdquo;</em></a> which was published in 1964. The book is a collection of 16 essays from the Sword where Dr. Rice dealt with theological and cultural error.</p>
<p>Here are my impressions from the book:</p>
<h3>Dr. Rice was not afraid to contend for the faith, even when it meant contending against other independent Baptist ministers.</h3><br />
This little book is full of critiques of various articles, books, and sermons put out by other Pastors, some of whom&nbsp;were independent Baptist and had written in the Sword. He made it clear that he believed it is sometimes necessary to rebuke public error and that he was not going to do that on partisan lines. He wasn&rsquo;t sticking his fingers in his ears when it came to his friends and comrades.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/bdc3d971ff8ced9c0c43ca713c8268c1.jpeg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1809 size-medium" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/bdc3d971ff8ced9c0c43ca713c8268c1-225x300.jpeg" alt="bdc3d971ff8ced9c0c43ca713c8268c1" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Despite that&hellip;</p>
<h3>Dr. Rice never painted with a broad brush when he dealt with theological error.</h3><br />
What I was most impressed with in these articles was Dr. Rice&rsquo;s fairness. He did not attack straw men. He did not over-generalize. He dealt with individual issues and did so on ideological grounds using the Bible and logic. He did not call people names. He used terms like &ldquo;liberal&rdquo;, &ldquo;neo-evangelical&rdquo;, &ldquo;fundamentalist&rdquo;, &ldquo;evangelical&rdquo; etc. in a very precise way. He seemed to genuinely like people, even people when he opposed their ideas.</p>
<h3>Dr. Rice did not go &ldquo;hard right&rdquo; on ever issue.</h3><br />
In a couple of the articles in the book, Dr. Rice defended a moderate position against people more conservative than he. He didn&rsquo;t seem to be falling all over himself trying to position himself as the most conservative guy out there, he seemed to want to align himself with the Bible, no matter what that decision cost him in terms of friendship or influence.</p>
<h3>Dr. Rice sometimes quoted other Bible versions.</h3><br />
There are a couple of instances in the book where Dr. Rice quotes another Bible version, preferring the wording of, say, the ASV to the KJV.</p>
<p>What?!?!?</p>
<p>At no point in this book did Dr. Rice give the impression that King James onlyism is an acid test for fellowship. He wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fellowship with himself. (BTW, I'm KJVo, I just wonder at what point King James onlysim became the dividing line.)</p>

<h3>Dr. Rice believed strongly in interdenominationalism.</h3><br />
There is an entire chapter in the book devoted to a defense of interdenominationalism. Dr. Rice believed that there was some denominationalism that was toxic, and stated why he had come out of the Southern Baptist Convention, but at the same time, he mentioned the many, even the majority of Southern Baptists as people who he would still fellowship with. While clearly defining his own Baptist affiliation, he defended fellowshipping with and preaching for Presbyterians, methodists and non-denominationalists.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2><br />
Here&rsquo;s my point: <strong>if Dr. Rice was alive today, he probably wouldn&rsquo;t be welcome in many &ldquo;old paths&rdquo; independent Baptist pulpits. He certainly would NOT fit in with the crowd that most likes to claim his legacy.</strong></p>
<p>I can already hear the opposition: &ldquo;But Dr. Rice changed.&rdquo; Really?? Show me. The man was a prolific writer. Show me the article where Dr. Rice repudiated his position on interdonominationalism or the King James. While we are on the subject of change, isn&rsquo;t it the crowd that most likes to claim Rice in their legacy that tells us its evil for a preacher to change and that great men don&rsquo;t change?</p>
<p>So from this book and others, this is my opinion of Dr. Rice:</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rice was an independent. </strong> He thought for himself. He resisted outside control of his ministry. His attachment was to the scripture. He had strong disagreements with his theological predecessors and even strong disagreements with his preacher friends.</p>
<p><strong>He was also pretty fair. </strong> He dealt with ideological and philosophical challenges on ideological and philosophical grounds, not by trying to assassinate the character of his opponents. He didn&rsquo;t call people names. He didn&rsquo;t over-generalize.</p>
<p>I think those are admirable qualities that are not only missing, but attacked in modern fundamentalism. I think that we have a group that wants to claim Rice in their legacy while instituting the very denominational uniformity that Rice balked at. I think we need more Old Paths preachers like John R. Rice.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
