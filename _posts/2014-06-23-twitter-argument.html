<p><strong>Some days I&rsquo;m not very proud of myself, and today was definitely one of those days.</strong></p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons I blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes I blog because I believe in earnestly contending for the faith, and I think that is part of it.</li>
<li>Sometimes I blog because I feel like there are a lot of dismissive things said about young IFB pastors that are on their face untrue.</li>
<li>Sometimes I blog because I want to pass on some tidbit of technical knowledge I'm excited about.</li>
<li>Sometimes&nbsp;I blog because I find that writing brings clarity to the stuff going on in my head.</li>
<li>Sometimes I blog because I&rsquo;m defending my own ego.</li><br />
</ul><br />
<strong>It&rsquo;s that last thing that I&rsquo;m not proud of.</strong> A couple of days ago, a critic of my writing posted a general tweet about misspelling preachers&rsquo; names. This happened just a couple of hours after I posted an article in which I misspelled a preacher&rsquo;s name and I assumed he was talking about me.</p>
<p>So this morning, I called him out on it. But I more than called him out on it, I argued with him, on a public forum, off and on for over an hour. It wasn&rsquo;t pretty.</p>
<p>It was petty and stupid and very &ldquo;infantile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I want to publicly apologize for that. Whatever good reasons for social networking and blogging exist, defending my own pride isn&rsquo;t one of them. If you follow me on twitter and had to read a lengthy argument between me and another pastor. I apologize. I&rsquo;ll do my best to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t happen again.</p>
<p>If in the future my writing seems a little bit &ldquo;punchy&rdquo; or &ldquo;personal.&rdquo; Please send me a message, remind me of this post, and keep me accountable.</p>
