<p>As Baptists, we claim to be people of the book. We claim to love God and God's Word and to faithfully and diligently try to live it out. We are nothing if we are not biblicists.</p>
<p>That's why one of the most troubling things to me is when Baptists mistreat scripture. I've experienced an alarming willingness with some preachers to explain away wholesale large parts of the Bible: whether they be doctrines they don't want to deal with, or commands that they find uncomfortable. Both "conservative" and "liberal" Christians do this, and it needs to stop.</p>
<p>One of the things that Paul could say about his ministry was:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."</em> (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/2Corinthians4%3A2" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>)</blockquote><br />
In my opinion, when you explain away scripture, you are "handling the word of God deceitfully." How do modern Baptists "explain away" scripture? In my experience, they most commonly do it in these three ways:</p>
<h3>1. with hyper-dispensationalism</h3><br />
I am a dispensationalist. I believe God works through different groups in different ages different ways. That being said, I do think there are a lot of hyper-dispensationalists who use the concept of dispensationalism to excuse themselves from many of God's commands and teachings.</p>
<p>The most common form of hyper-dispensationalism that I run into is people explaining away the gospels. Many of Christ's commands, parables, and actions don't jive with a lot of modern ideas about the gospel and grace. (I mean, at one point, he told a "seeker" to go and sell all that he had. Talk about "adding works to salvation.") Rather than take the time to work through these things, hyper-dispensationalists have a handy "get out of uncomfortable commands of Jesus free card" that they can pull. They just say that the dispensation of grace hadn't started yet. Close the door and walk away.</p>
<p>But did Jesus really intend most of his teaching in the gospels just for his first century hearers? Did he really intend for it to be shelved (as many hyper-dispensationalists believe) until the Kingdom age? I think there is a clear answer: No. Part of the great commission is <em>"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you:"</em> If the great commission is for the church age, the teachings of Jesus are too.</p>
<p>Another way people explain away scripture is&hellip;</p>
<h3>2. with pragmatism</h3><br />
There are a lot of people who are more attached to "what works" than to what God's Word says. Any time they come across a scripture that, put into practice, might rock the boat. (Like, for instance, <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Matthew18" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Matthew 18</a>.) They say "that will never work."</p>
<p>Pragmatism can live for a long time without exposing itself, because many preachers take an approach to preaching that allows them to skip over any passage they are uncomfortable with. They don't have to come out and say that Paul's teaching on gender roles or liberty (or anything else they don't like) won't work because they are not preaching <em>"the whole counsel of God"</em>. They are jumping from comfortable topic to comfortable topic.</p>
<p>One more way people explain away scripture is&hellip;</p>
<h3>3. with proof texts</h3><br />
There is some degree of doctrinal tension in the Bible. For just two examples (and there are others), take the subjects of God's sovereignty and man's responsibility or liberty and law and you can find individual verses that seem like a slam dunk for both positions. Often, somebody will be so attached to one side of that debate, that anytime someone from the other side makes a biblical point, they pull out there slam dunk verse and attempt to walk away like the battle is over. They pick and choose one clear verse over another and put their fingers in their ears whenever they hear scripture that doesn't support their side.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the right thing to do in this situation is to really ask if God's position isn't a bit more nuanced than yours on the subject. God isn't the author of confusion, and if there is ample scripture to confuse your position, then maybe it's not God's position. At the very least, the existence of those verses demands that we treat those who hold a different position charitably, rather than standing on our side of the cliff playing the "my proof text is clearer than yours" game.</p>
<p>The Bible does not say "My favorite scripture is given by inspiration of God" but <em>"All scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable."</em> Whenever you explain away scripture using these or any other methods, you need to do serious soul searching to see if you really believe that <em>"all scripture is God inspired"</em>. If you do believe all of it is inspired - then you should change your methods. If you don't, just admit to yourself and to others that your religion does not come from God, but is of your own making.</p>
