<p>This is the fourth post in my series of &ldquo;Things Pastor&rsquo;s Could Learn from Jamie Oliver.&rdquo; Due to the odd nature of this series, I highly recommend you read the <a title="Five Things Pastors Can Learn From Jamie Oliver: Introduction." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/five-things-pastors-can-learn-from-jamie-oliver-introduction/">introduction</a> and other things.</p>
<p>The fourth thing pastors could learn form Jamie Oliver is:</p>
<h1 id="beenthusiastic">Be Enthusiastic</h1><br />
To say that Jamie Oliver is enthusiastic about cooking and gardening would be an understatement. When you watch him, you can&rsquo;t help but get caught up by his enthusiasm. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing you just can&rsquo;t fake. It&rsquo;s a huge draw.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/enthusiasm.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-590" alt="enthusiasm" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/enthusiasm-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>If a chef can get and stay that excited about teaching people how to cook, shouldn&rsquo;t pastors be able to get excited about teaching people the words of life. Jamie Oliver is providing people with temporary health and enjoyment, but we have the means to provide people with both temporal and eternal health and enjoyment. We can also provide people with an eternal purpose and a relationship with the gracious Savior.</p>
<h2 id="beenthusiasticaboutyoursavior.">Be enthusiastic about your Savior.</h2><br />
I have a confession to make, I don&rsquo;t talk about Jesus nearly as much as I should. I&rsquo;m not talking about preaching or teaching, I&rsquo;m talking about just praising God in my everyday conversation. There are people in my church who are constantly praising God and referring to Him in daily conversation. I don&rsquo;t do that enough.</p>
<p>If we truly have a relationship with Jesus Christ, we should talk about it openly, naturally, and enthusiastically. If we can talk enthusiastically about our wife or kids, we should talk enthusiastically about our Lord.</p>
<h2 id="beenthusiasticaboutwhatyoudo.">Be enthusiastic about what you do.</h2><br />
One of my pet peeves is when pastors talk about the ministry like it is some kind of terrible burden. God didn&rsquo;t sentence me to a life of hard labor in Siberia when He called me to the ministry, He allowed me to do one the most rewarding, purposeful work I could possibly do. The ministry is a blessing, not a curse.</p>
<p>I think we pastors should speak enthusiastically about the ministry. It is a blessed thing to serve God, and those around us should be able to see it.</p>
<h2 id="beenthusiasticaboutyourmessage.">Be enthusiastic about your message.</h2><br />
2 Peter 1 teaches us that God&rsquo;s Word has everything that Christians need in order to live the life God wants them to live. That is an awesome truth. We pastors get to share and teach a book that doesn&rsquo;t just inform, it transforms. A living breathing book that changes lives. What a pleasure!</p>
<p>If Jamie Oliver can get and stay excited about teaching people how to cook, shouldn&rsquo;t we be able to get and stay excited about teaching people the how to walk with and live for God?</p>
