<p>We did pretty well on our income taxes this year and it came back about the same time we put the last nail in the coffin of our debt, so to celebrate we got &nbsp;iPads. &nbsp;To be honest, I got my iPad (like most people) to be a big shiny toy. &nbsp;After two months of use, I have found the iPad to be a great ministry tool. &nbsp;The built in email and calendar app have become indispensable to me, as has the todo list manager Wunderlist. &nbsp;Here are five apps and how I use them for ministry.</p></p>
<h3>Google Books</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/google-books.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-26" title="google books" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2011/08/google-books-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="134" height="180" /></a></p></p>
<p>Google has been going through libraries for years, digitizing old books. &nbsp;A few years ago, no one quite understood all the effort, I mean, who wants to read on the computer. &nbsp;Enter the iPad. &nbsp;Within ten minutes of searching through google books, I was walking around with hundreds of devotional books, classic christian biographies and commentaries. &nbsp;The kicker, I didn't pay a penny.</p></p>
<p>The<a href="itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-books/id400989007?mt=8"> google books</a> library includes&nbsp;library&nbsp;collections from very old&nbsp;seminaries. &nbsp;Pretty much, if a book is in public domain (written before 1930) then it is free on google books.</p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<h3>Filemaker Go</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/gotoolkit_main.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-28 alignright" title="gotoolkit_main" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2011/08/gotoolkit_main-300x189.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="189" /></a></p></p>
<p>At Fairview, we use Filemaker databases for everything. &nbsp;For our prayer requests, to keep track of prospects and contacts, to register campers and bus riders, and to plan events. &nbsp;With <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filemaker-go/id379686220?mt=8">Filemaker Go</a> and an iPad, I can open up my iPad and pull up almost any information I need for the ministry. &nbsp;The iPad app is a full featured client, meaning you can't create a database on it, but you can enter information on it and search through information to your hearts content.</p></p>
<h3></h3></p>

<h3>Olive Tree Bible Reader</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/olive-tree.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-29" title="olive tree" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2011/08/olive-tree-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="210" /></a></p></p>
<p>There are lots of Bible apps for the iPad and I have a few of them. &nbsp;There are several things that set Olive Tree apart. &nbsp;The first is that the <a href="http://http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/biblereader/id287455446?mt=8">Olive Tree</a> experience is about as close as you can get to a real Bible. &nbsp;Everything from the font to the color of the paper to the way paragraphs and chapters are headed looks just like a paper Bible. &nbsp;Olive Tree makes copying verses to another program simple, offers lots of options for highlighting and notes, and even syncs notes with your evernote account. &nbsp;Olive Tree is free software, and the one caveat of the app is that it doesn't have study tools like strongs and the Treasury of Scripture Knowlege built in (these are both available for a price).</p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<h3>Notability</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/notability-for-ipad-8211-app-review_1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-30" title="notability-for-ipad-8211-app-review_1" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2011/08/notability-for-ipad-8211-app-review_1-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="168" /></a></p></p>
<p>One of the coolest things I've learned about using my iPad is that if you are a touch typist, you can type notes just about anywhere. &nbsp;I have been taking notes with this thing in church and am starting to compile a pretty big database of sermons. &nbsp;I also take notes during our prayer meetings and email the notes to our secretary so she can enter them the next day. &nbsp;My favorite note taking app is called "<a href="http://http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notability/id360593530?mt=8">Notability</a>" and is$ .99 in the app store. &nbsp;It has some neat note organization features, the ability to record sound and add pictures to your notes, and the ability to send editable notes to your&nbsp;computer&nbsp;via dropbox.</p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<h3>Keynote Remote</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/keynote-remote.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-31" title="keynote remote" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2011/08/keynote-remote-300x200.png" alt="" width="240" height="160" /></a></p></p>
<p>This one isn't really an iPad app, it's an iPhone app that I am running on my iPad, but it is still useful to me in the ministry. &nbsp;I use Keynote every week in Children's Church and<a href="http://http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keynote-remote/id300719251?mt=8"> this app</a> allows me to control my slideshow by flicking my fingers. &nbsp;I can see the slide on my iPad so I am not turning around, and I don't have to use presenter display on my computer. &nbsp;The app frees me up a lot.</p></p>
