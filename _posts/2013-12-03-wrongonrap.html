<p>When I was in college, I had a unique job. I was the game room director at an inner city teen program for the Boy's and Girl's Club in Knoxville, TN. On any given day, there would be 60 kids in the building and 5-6 staff members. Many days I was the only white guy.</p>
<p>I fell in love with a lot of those kids. They had hurdles they were facing that dwarfed anything that would be even in our nightmares. Many of them were going home to single mothers, going to school every day in schools that were war zones and barely educating them, and living in places where drug deals, police raids, gang warfare and shootings were a regular occurrence.</p>
<p>In that environment, rap music was everywhere. As I rode to pick kids up or drop them off, rap music would play (I had no control over this.) Often, kids would either play or sing rap music in the building where I worked. It was ever-present. It was extremely toxic.</p>
<p>I remember being repulsed (and I'm still repulsed) by the lyrics of that music. Kids not old enough to shave would be singing about prostitution, gang rape, and unmentionable sex acts. Woman were degraded to ridiculously low levels. Allowing rap music, at least that variety, is itself a mass crime upon our young people. It is music at it's basest level.</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://www.albertmohler.com">Albert Mohler.</a> I listen regularly to his <a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/category/the-briefing/">"the Briefing"</a> podcast and find it to be an extremely helpful way to listen to the news. I have no doubt that he is a sincere Christian and that he believes in standing for the truth. I appreciate his position on scriptural preaching and the work he has done in cleaning up Southern Seminary. I'm pretty sure he'd lick me in a battle of the wits 11 out of 10 times. So, while I wouldn't have him preach in my church (because of some of his associations and Bible version differences), I'm glad he's around.</p>
<p>But I think he is dead wrong on rap music.</p>
<p>On yesterday's <a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2013/12/02/the-briefing-12-02-13/">"the briefing"</a> and in a <a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2013/12/01/thinking-about-thinking-about-rap-unexpected-thoughts-over-thanksgiving/">companion blog post</a>, Mohler weighed in on the recent online Christian rap music controversy. Surprisingly, he acted the part of a Christian rap apologist. Making the point that his favorite music, Bach, was considered too base for church in it's day and saying that rap music needed to be redeemed with the gospel.</p>
<p>I found this, coming from Mohler, to be really off-putting. He wholeheartedly recommended a book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Johnny-Cant-Sing-Hymns/dp/1596381957">"Why Johnny Can't Sing Hymns"</a> on past podcast (which seems to have been removed) and has come out many times bemoaning the state of Christian music in our day. He's also a constant and loud critic of pornography.</p>
<p>Can pornography be redeemed with the gospel? Is it possible that some "artistic expressions" are themselves morally inconsistent with the message of the Bible? Is it not true that when God redeems something, he also changes it?</p>
<p>I would say rap music, at least the rap music I've had the displeasure to experience, is the musical equivalent of pornography. It appeals to the basest lusts of our bodies, it infiltrates our thinking and is hard to remove, and it has long term effects on our lives.</p>
<p>Music, like words, is a form of communication. It is emotional communication. If there are emotions that are sinful, then there can be music that is sinful as well. If the music fits lyrics about gangster violence, objectionable sex acts, and drug use - perhaps it's not the best emotional vehicle for singing about the thrice holy God.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;"</em> <strong><a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Peter1%3A14-15" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Peter 1:14-15</a></strong></blockquote></p>
