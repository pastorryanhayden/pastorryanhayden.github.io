<p>In reviewing a book, a blogger like me risks credibility when he is too enthusiastically positive.&nbsp; Saying things like "one of the best books I've ever read" or "an instant classic" or "pure gold" makes him look like he is simple or some kind of fan boy.&nbsp; If that is the case, in reviewing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mondays-My-Old-Pastor-Sometimes/dp/0849947251/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346954266&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mondays+with+my+old+pastor">Mondays With My Old Pastor</a> by Jose Navajo I am faced with the choice between credibility and honesty.&nbsp; I just liked the book that much.</p>
<p>I choose honesty.&nbsp; When I picked up the book, my expectations were pretty low.&nbsp; After all, the book was written by a Spanish pastor I have never heard of and presumably was written in Spanish and translated.&nbsp; The price was right (it was a free reviewer copy) so I decided to give it a chance regardless.&nbsp; I'm very glad I did.</p>
<p>The book is a little unorthodox.&nbsp; Rather than the typical pastoral self-help written in straightforward non-fiction, this book tells a story (in first person) of a fictional pastor going through a period of personal unrest and seeking answers through weekly visits to his old pastor, now a retired 84 year old man living in solitude in the country.&nbsp; The narrator's ministry and personal problems create the perfect backdrop for the wise advice of the "old pastor", which take up most of the book.</p>
<p>The writing is also a little bit flowery (at least to the taste of an American living in the Midwest).&nbsp; Despite the translation, you can tell it was written by a foreigner because no self respecting American would allow his prose to wax so sentimental or poetic.</p>
<p>To add to this, at the end of the book, there is a pretty obvious reminder that the book is a translation.&nbsp; It ends with an acrostic, that if you are reading in English, just isn't.</p>
<p>Despite being unorthodox and at times flowery, I am so glad I took the time to read this book.&nbsp; The problems the narrator talks about are so easy for this pastor to relate to and the advice the "old pastor" gives is just dripping with wisdom, spiritual maturity, and common sense.&nbsp; Everything from what to preach, to being hurt by your parishioners to marital problems are covered, and the advice is so good and rich that I think this book will be the first one I reach for whenever those problems arise in my ministry.</p>
<p>I'm so impressed with this book, I think I'll buy a dozen copies to give away, not so much out of generosity as I just don't want to part with my copy.</p>
<p>I've already used stories I read in this book as sermon illustrations, and I typed up some of the principles from the book to go on the wall in my new office.&nbsp; (Yes, I liked the book that much.)</p>
<p>My advice to you:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mondays-My-Old-Pastor-Sometimes/dp/0849947251/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346954266&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mondays+with+my+old+pastor"> just go buy the book</a>.&nbsp; If you are a pastor, or involved in ministry in any way, you won't regret it.</p>
