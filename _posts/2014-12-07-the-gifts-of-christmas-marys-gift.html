<p><i>Every Sunday Morning, I post my sermon manuscript here. &nbsp;I know most people don&rsquo;t have time to read a full manuscript, and I also know that these manuscripts will&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;have even more spelling and grammar errors in them than my normal blog posts, but I&rsquo;m going to post them here anyway&nbsp;in the hope that they can help someone. &nbsp;This is the third&nbsp;message in a series titled: <b>The Gifts of Christmas</b>. &nbsp;We will resume Ephesians in January.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to be back this morning. I want to thank Brother Rincker for the good job I&rsquo;m sure he did last Sunday morning, and I want to thank Brother Roberts for preaching on Sunday Evening, and I hear he did a good job too. He&rsquo;s going to have to do it again when I&rsquo;m there to see it.</p>
<p>This morning, we are going to look at one of the strangest, most awesome and most misunderstood stories in all of the Bible. The story of how the Mary, a virgin, found out that she was going to be the mother of the Messiah.</p>
<p>Take your Bibles with me and turn again to the book of Luke, chapter 1. Luke chapter 1. We are going to be reading verses 26-56 this morning - which I know is a lot of scripture to read, but I think it will be worth it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;<a>Luk 1:26-28, 30-39, 41-45 KJV</a> 26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name <a>was</a> Mary. 28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, <a>thou that art</a> highly favoured, the Lord <a>is</a> with thee: blessed <a>art</a> thou among women. 29 And when she saw <a>him</a>, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. 30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. 31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: 33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. 34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? 35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. 36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. 37 For with God nothing shall be impossible. 38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. 39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; 40 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth. 41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: 42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed <a>art</a> thou among women, and blessed <a>is</a> the fruit of thy womb. 43 And whence <a>is</a> this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 45 And blessed <a>is</a> she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
Let&rsquo;s stop there and I&rsquo;ll try to quickly go over what just happened in the Bible:</p>
<p>This passage is all about the angel Gabriel visiting a girl named Mary. Now, a couple of weeks ago, we talked about who the angel Gabriel is. There are only two named angels in the Bible, three if you count Lucifer. Lucifer - who became Satan. Micheal - who was sort of the Rambo angel. He&rsquo;s the one who shows up when there is some serious battle to be done and then there is Gabriel. Gabriel is an exalted angel, Gabriel serves as the throne room attendant and special messenger of God.</p>
<p>But who is Mary?</p>
<p>The last time we looked at one of these Christmas stories, I told you that Zacharias was a nobody. If Zacharias was a nobody, Mary was less than a nobody.</p>
<p>Here is what it has to say about her in 26-28:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name <a>was</a> Mary&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
So let&rsquo;s just break this down real quick:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>She was from Galilee.</strong> Galilee wasn&rsquo;t exactly prime real estate in Jesus day. Galilee was separated from the rest of Israel by Samaria, and the Jews hated the Samaritans. It was kind of a backwater place of little importance. The big city - Jerusalem - that was in southern Israel. That was in the part that was called Judea when they were still a kingdom. But Mary was from Galilee - flyover country.</li>
<li><strong>She was from Nazareth.</strong> We don&rsquo;t know much about Nazareth, after all, this was 2000 years ago, but we do know this about it. It didn&rsquo;t have a good reputation. When the disciple Nathaniel found out that Jesus was from Nazareth in John 1:46 he asked &ldquo;Can anything good come out of Nazareth?&rdquo;</li><br />
</ul><br />
Folks, that&rsquo;s not a compliment. I can kind of appreciate this a little because my mom is from a place people like to look down on and make fun of. She&rsquo;s from Lynn, Massachusetts. In New England, people make up little ditties like &ldquo;Lynn, Lynn, the city of sin, you never come out the way you came in.&rdquo; I even saw this meme about Lynn on Facebook this week. (Show Picture.) Yep.</p>
<p>So, folks, the idea is she wasn&rsquo;t from a high society kind of place. She was from the middle of nowhere, and a part of the middle of nowhere that had a bad reputation. What else does it say about her?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>She was a virgin.</strong> So she was unmarried.</li>
<li><strong>Espoused.</strong> She was legally bonded to be married, but she hadn&rsquo;t consummated the marriage yet. Remember that in Bible times, being engaged was a legally bonding relationship just like being married was. Who was she engaged to?</li>
<li><strong>Espoused to Joseph</strong> She was engaged to a guy who was a craftsman - a carpenter. Do you know what that means, it means probably He didn&rsquo;t own land. He didn&rsquo;t have a big farm. He wasn&rsquo;t a pharisee or a member of the Sanhedrin. He was just a regular blue-tunic kind of guy.</li><br />
</ul><br />
So the point I&rsquo;m trying to get you to see here is that Mary was a nobody. She was probably a teenager. She lived in an area that was probably poor and was engaged to a man who was probably poor.</p>
<p>Mary is going about her business doing whatever it was she did when Gabriel comes to visit. And what does Gabriel say? He says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;Hail, <a>thou that art</a> highly favoured, the Lord <a>is</a> with thee: blessed <a>art</a> thou among women.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
What?!?</p>
<p>Gabriel - the throne room attendant of God. One of the highest beings in the universe - meets Mary, this poor girl from the middle of nowhere and says &ldquo;Hail.&rdquo; He calls her &ldquo;Highly favored&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now - don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s strange? Don&rsquo;t you think Mary was probably a little taken back by all of this? Probably pretty scared?</p>
<p>But I want to tell you, nothing compared to what the angel told her next. He told her that she was going to have a son, and the son was going to be the messiah.</p>
<p>So Mary asked the obvious question &ldquo;How can this be, seeing that I know not a man?&rdquo; She was saying &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m a virgin. Virgin&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t have babies. How is this going to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the angel explained that it would be a miraculous birth. That she would conceive of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Stop right there. Think about this. At some point, this conversation with the angel is going to end, and Mary is going to have to tell somebody that she is pregnant. She is eventually going to have a big bump that she is going to have to be explaining to people.</p>
<p>Can you even begin to imagine how hard some of those conversations were going to be? Imagine if your daughter - I don&rsquo;t care how virtuous she is - imagine if she comes to you and says &ldquo;Daddy, I&rsquo;ve got some news and you&rsquo;re not going to like it&rdquo; and then tells you she&rsquo;s having a baby but she&rsquo;s still a virgin. You&rsquo;d think she was crazy.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got to tell her future husband. He knows he&rsquo;s not the dad. Imagine how that conversation went?</p>
<p>This is Israel - she could be facing the death penalty.</p>
<p>One of my favorite books is a book called &ldquo;The Heart of Mid-Lothian&rdquo; by Sir Walter Scott. I actually bought it when I visited Scotland right before I went off to college, and it&rsquo;s a book about Scotland. It&rsquo;s about a two sisters, and one of them goes into the city to live and ends up pregnant. And she won&rsquo;t tell who the baby&rsquo;s father is. She refuses to name the father - and so they were going to have her executed - and her sister goes off to London to beg for a pardon from the Queen.</p>
<p>That kind of thing was happening in Scotland in the 1700s - Imagine what it was like in Israel in the 0s.</p>
<p>And do you know what? For the rest of her life, Mary was going to live with this stigma. Joseph would live with the stigma too. It was the black cloud that was going to be over them forever. It was the elephant in the room. They probably heard people whispering about them when they went into a public place. The ladies probably pointed at her and snickered in the synagogue.</p>
<p>This was extremely good news from our perspective, but in the moment, it came with some really, really hard baggage.</p>
<p>So please, keep that in mind, try to put yourself in her shoes, and then on in verse 46.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;<a>Luk 1:46-56 KJV</a> 46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. 48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. 49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy <a>is</a> his name. 50 And his mercy <a>is</a> on them that fear him from generation to generation. 51 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. 52 He hath put down the mighty from <a>their</a> seats, and exalted them of low degree. 53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. 54 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of <a>his</a> mercy; 55 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever. 56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
<strong>The Roman Catholics make too much of Mary.</strong> They treat her like a fourth member of the Trinity. They say that she is the mediator between us and Christ. They teach that not only did Mary have a virgin birth, she was born of a virgin birth and she stayed a virgin her entire life. Not one of those things has one shred of Biblical support.</p>
<p><strong>But I&rsquo;m afraid we don&rsquo;t make enough of Mary.</strong></p>
<p>Those verses we just read, in my opinion, show some of the greatest faith in all of the Bible. You see, we can&rsquo;t even IMAGINE the kind of hard time Mary must have been going through. The Bible tells us nothing of her home life and little of the reaction people had to her - but they must have been treating her like she was a loon. Joseph had made up his mind to divorce her (after deciding not to have her stoned.) She had to be in great duress.</p>
<p>But she get&rsquo;s to her cousins house and what does she do? Does she fall on Elisabeth crying? Does she hit the freezer, pick up some Ice Cream and have a pity party? Does she say even a word about her situation?</p>
<p>No. She praises God. She thanks God for the amazing privilege that was given to her.<br />
That is unbelievable faith.</p>
<p>This little song of Mary - Christians have called it the &ldquo;Magnificat&rdquo; for a very long time - this song teaches us some things about what it means to have real faith.</p>
<p><strong><em>So let me pray, and very quickly give you three lessons we can learn from Mary.</em></strong></p>
<p>The first lesson we can learn is&hellip;</p>
<h1>1. Faith believes when it&rsquo;s difficult.</h1><br />
What amazes me most about this song of Mary was that she sang it in the first place. That she had the faith to believe God&rsquo;s word despite what she was going through is amazing.</p>
<p>Last night, I watched a video and I shared it on Facebook. It was a video about a man in Asia - Cambodia or Burma or somewhere like that who was jailed for his faith. The man was placed in solitary and beaten. He was starved and he lay on a cold floor in a windowless cell all for his faith in Jesus. Do you know what He most wanted in that cell? Do you know what He prayed for? He prayed for a Bible. A Bible.</p>
<p>After years of this - they trusted him enough to let him go out and get firewood. He snuck a Bible back in and was beaten for it and put back in solitary again.</p>
<p>Now, if believing in Christ put you or I in prison, wouldn&rsquo;t our inclination be to give it up? To denounce Christ? That&rsquo;s human nature. &ldquo;This whole faith thing isn&rsquo;t working out for me.&rdquo; &ldquo;God must not care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how real faith works people. You see, faith is not sight. Faith is not believing in God&rsquo;s word because it works or because it makes you popular and wealthy. Faith is faith.</p>
<p>I promise you that if you persevere in the faith, at some point, probably at many points - you are going to scratch your head and think - &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t working.&rdquo; &ldquo;God, how could you allow this?&rdquo; People are probably going to think you are crazy.</p>
<p>But faith perseveres. Faith believes even when sight tells it not to. Mary is such a strong example of that.</p>
<p>The second thing Mary&rsquo;s song teaches us about faith is&hellip;</p>
<h1>2. Faith keeps an eternal perspective through difficult times.</h1><br />
Some of you have been through some awful, awful things and some of you are going through some awful things right now.</p>
<p>Some of you have been in places where it&rsquo;s really hard to quote the verse <em>&ldquo;All things work together for good.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>What do you do in a time like that?</p>
<p>Well, look at Mary here - look at what she sang about - she sang about being blessed among women. She sang about how future generations would look on her as the mother of the Messiah. She sang about Jesus.</p>
<p>Is that what people were saying about her then? No! They were probably saying she was crazy. They were probably saying she should just give it up. But she was looking at it from an eternal perspective.</p>
<p>Do you know what faith says in difficult times? It says &ldquo;God - I don&rsquo;t know why this just happened. I don&rsquo;t need to know why. I just know that you are working, and I know at some point in my life or in eternity, I&rsquo;ll understand why things are going this way. I&rsquo;m just going to trust you and rejoice in what you are doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You see, the Christian understands that the here and now is not it. We understand that someday, we&rsquo;ll stand before God and receive rewards. Someday, we will reap what we sow. When we suffer persecution, we can rejoice. Rejoice in persecution. Why? because great is our reward in heaven. Because God allowed the prophets before to be persecuted and used them and He&rsquo;ll use us.</p>
<p>Faith keeps an eternal perspective in difficulty.</p>
<p>One more point&hellip;</p>
<h1>3. Faith rejoices in the character of God through difficult times.</h1><br />
Look at verse 46</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;And Mary said, My soul doth magnify&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
What does Her soul magnify? <em>&ldquo;The Lord.&rdquo;</em> Look, she&rsquo;s in extreme duress, and she&rsquo;s singing things like</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
She&rsquo;s singing about God&rsquo;s mercy and God&rsquo;s justice and God&rsquo;s strength.</p>
<p>Things are really tough for her - But God hasn&rsquo;t changed. He&rsquo;s still loving, He&rsquo;s still merciful, He&rsquo;s still got all of this under control.</p>
<p>There was this rich businessman and lawyer that lived at the end of the 1800s named Horatio Spafford. He was planning on taking an extended vacation with his family in Europe, but then the Chicago fire happened and he had a lot of work to take care of so he sent his wife and his four young daughters across and planned to meet up with them. Along the way, their ship had a collision and quickly sank. He received a telegram from his wife that said &ldquo;Saved&hellip;alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can you imagine losing four kids at once. I&rsquo;m just trying to think of how me and Amanda would get on if we lost Audrey and Molly and Noah. I don&rsquo;t want to think about losing one of them.</p>
<p>Anyways - Stafford went to go get his wife, and when they crossed where the ship had gone down, Stafford wrote this song:</p>
<p><em>When peace like a river, attendeth my way,</em><br />
<em> When sorrows like sea billows roll;</em><br />
<em> Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to know,a</em><br />
<em> It is well, it is well, with my soul.</em></p>
<p><em>Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,</em><br />
<em> Let this blest assurance control,</em><br />
<em> That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,</em><br />
<em> And hath shed His own blood for my soul.</em></p>
<p><em>My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!</em><br />
<em> My sin, not in part but the whole,</em><br />
<em> Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,</em><br />
<em> Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!</em></p>
<p><em>For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:</em><br />
<em> If Jordan above me shall roll,</em><br />
<em> No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life,</em><br />
<em> Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.</em></p>
<p><em>But Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,</em><br />
<em> The sky, not the grave, is our goal;</em><br />
<em> Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!</em><br />
<em> Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul.</em></p>
<p><em>And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,</em><br />
<em> The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;</em><br />
<em> The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,</em><br />
<em> A song in the night, oh my soul!</em></p>
<p><em>Refrain:</em><br />
<em> It is well, (it is well),</em><br />
<em> With my soul, (with my soul)</em><br />
<em> It is well, it is well, with my soul.</em></p>
<p>Do you know what that is? That&rsquo;s faith. That&rsquo;s supernatural faith. Persevering faith. Faith that keeps an eternal perspective. Faith that never loses track of the character of God in hardship.</p>
<p>Listen church, God has called us to be people of faith. We aren&rsquo;t people of sight - we are people of faith. The just shall live by??? What??? <strong>FAITH</strong>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what faith will cost you. But I know what it can cost you, and I know how it acts in hardship. Mary is a great example of this.</p>
<p><strong><em>Let&rsquo;s stand for invitation and prayer.</em></strong></p>
