<h3>James 3 on Strife</h3><br />
James 3 is one of my favorite passages of scripture. Most people are familiar with the middle of James 3, where James talks about the danger of the tongue, but few seem to emphasize the overall message of the chapter.</p>
<p>The first phrase in James 3 sets the tone:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Brethren, be not many masters.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
This chapter is talking about people who want to be teachers or speakers. Apparently, the original audience of the book of James had the same problem as the early Corinthian church: everybody wanted to be the preacher and nobody wanted to be the congregation. So James writes this chapter to warn them that not everyone who speaks is of God, and that those of us who speak and preach are going to have to answer for what we say. All of it builds up to the end which says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. 14 But if ye have <strong>bitter envying</strong> and <strong>strife</strong> in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. 16 For where <strong>envying</strong> and <strong>strife</strong> is, there is confusion and every evil work. 17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.&rdquo;</em> (Emphasis added)</blockquote><br />
The principles of this passage apply to everyone, but in context, it specifically applies to preachers and it makes the point, in very clear terms, that if a preacher is characterized by envying and strife, then he does not have wisdom from God and will wreak havoc in the church.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cow_fight_by_jadedphotographer-d3del0e.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-698" alt="cow_fight_by_jadedphotographer-d3del0e" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/cow_fight_by_jadedphotographer-d3del0e-300x212.jpg" width="300" height="212" /></a></p>
<p>Tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll talk about envy. Today, I want to focus on <strong>strife</strong>. When was the last time you heard a preacher preach a message about the danger of strife? Did they apply it to preachers? I doubt it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t the only passage that emphasizes this. 1 Corinthians 3:3 says&hellip;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you <strong>envying</strong>, and <strong>strife</strong>, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?&rdquo;</em> (Emphasis added)</blockquote><br />
Strife is contentiousness. It is quarreling. It is always looking for a fight.</p>
<p>This puts us in a little bit of a quandary, because scripture also commands us to <em>&ldquo;earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints.&rdquo;</em> (Jude 2) Apparently, <strong>God wants us to contend without being contentious.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Just like preacher worship, contentiousness is something that scripture forbids and we have a tendency to lionize.</strong> There are many segments of fundamentalism where contentiousness is seen as a virtue. Contentiousness has even become a part of our identity; the historian George Marsden famously defined a fundamentalist as &ldquo;a evangelical that&rsquo;s mad about something.&rdquo; I disagree with his definition, but shouldn&rsquo;t that tell us something?</p>
<p>A preacher that isn&rsquo;t willing to fight for the truth of God&rsquo;s Word &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t worth his salt.&rdquo; Scripture says that heretics are to marked and avoided. Paul withstood Peter to the face. But there are a lot of men that are looking to fight about anything, no matter how trivial or subjective, and are probably motivated more by a streak of narcissism than by love for the truth.</p>
<p>We need to constantly remind ourselves that&hellip;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&hellip;the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace."</em> (James 3:17&ndash;18)</blockquote><br />
and</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;&hellip;the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient.&rdquo;</em> (2 Timothy 2:24)</blockquote><br />
and</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man&rsquo;s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.&rdquo;</em> (Ecclesiastes 8:1)</blockquote><br />
You don&rsquo;t have to carry on like a bull in a china shop to be &ldquo;a man of God.&rdquo; In fact, according to James 3:15, a contentious spirit is one of the fastest ways to identify yourself as as &ldquo;a man of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let's emphasize what scripture emphasizes.</p>

<p>[thumbsupbox]After I wrote this post (and planned the whole series) I found <a title="Humility in Baptist Churches: Pastor Paul Chappell" href="http://ministry127.com/pastoral-leadership/humility-in-baptist-churches">this post</a> by Dr. Paul Chappell which pretty much mentions everything that I am saying this week. <strong>Sometimes it's good to be wrong.</strong>[/thumbsupbox]</p>
