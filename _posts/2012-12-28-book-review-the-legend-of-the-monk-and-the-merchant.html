<p>The Legend of the Monk and the Merchant by Terry Felber is an odd kind of book for the twentyfirst century. It is an allegory. This particular allegory focuses on a child who was raised by monks but ulitmately chose to be a merchant as he passes on to his grandson the lessons he learned from his mentor and attributes to his succes. It was an interesting book that taught good (if not new) life lessons in an enjoyable way. I would reccomend it to a friend and can imagine myself having my kids read it some day.<br />
I first heard of this book from Dave Ramsay. Ramsay was talking on his radio show about five or so books that he makes all of his staff members read within the first few months under his employ. This book was on the list, and Ramsay said great things about it. (Don't bother finding the radio broadcast, he repeats the rave things he said in the preface.) When I found out the book was available for review, I was very excited to get to read it.<br />
The book really shines in how it uses scripture to debunk certain Christian myths about the evils of business and wealth. It is also interesting how it emphasizes the importance of a partnership between the merchants (busnessmen) and monks (ministers) for the kingdom of God. Beyond those two topics, the book reinforces principles about working hard, living within your means, and rebounding from tragedies very effectively.<br />
There is one thing I would change in this book: The books heroes are Roman Catholics working for the advancement of the Roman Catholic church. It seemed to me that the author was not a catholic, if he was, he quoted a lot of scripture for a catholic. So why use them as the analogy? Don't get me wrong, this isn't a pro-catholic book. The catholic church was probably used because it was nescessary for the central anology of the story. But as a Baptist pastor who believes we should be trying to win people from the Catholic church, I wish another analogy was used.<br />
Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze&reg;.com <http://BookSneeze&reg;.com> book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission&rsquo;s 16 CFR, Part 255</p>
