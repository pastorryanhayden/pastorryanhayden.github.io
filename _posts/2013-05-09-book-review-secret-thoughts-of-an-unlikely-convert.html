<p>What if I were to tell you that there was a woman who had for over a decade lived as a committed lesbian, who was a professor of "queer studies" and feminism at a major university, and who had been an advocate for radical abortion rights and every other far left agenda you can think of who is today a happily married wife to a pastor in an extremely conservative presbyterian denomination, a mother of four, and a committed follower of Christ.  That in and of itself is fascinating, and destroys so many of the myths perpetrated by secularists.  But what if I were to tell you that she has written a book, a memoir, of her journey from point A to point B.  If you care at all about current events and you have even a sliver of intellectual curiosity, I'd hope you go buy the book right away.</p></p>

<p>But <em>Secret Thoughts of An Unlikely Convert</em> by Rosaria Champagne Butterfield is so much more than a book to help you deal with the gay problem. It is a book that will radically challenge so many of your conceptions: conceptions about your fellow human beings, conceptions about evangelism, conceptions about evangelical Christianity, conceptions about the spectrum of Bible believers, and conceptions about what it means to be a godly husband or wife.  I read this book looking for ammunition to use against the gay rights activist who circle the wagon every time I write something in a public forum, and what I got was a non-stop barrage against my own conscience.  It made me feel at times like a coward, like a bigot, and like a narrow minded jerk.  Most importantly, its ignited in me a new passion to love sinners and to share Christ with them.  </p></p>
<p>(Lest you think I'm alluding to Rosaria Butterfield being soft on the sin of homosexuality.  I assure you, I am not.  She affirms the sinfulness of homosexuality completely.)</p></p>
<p>If you are the type of person that can't handle intellectual challenge, if you'd rather just sit in your ideological bunker and throw bombs at the sinful world around you than see them come to Christ and become trophies of grace like Dr. Butterfield or if you refuse to believe that anybody outside of your club is a committed and conservative follower of Christ then don't read this book.  If you do, at least be warned that you are handling dynamite and you will not come out unscathed.</p></p>

<p>If you think you can handle it - go buy it today.  You will not be sorry you did.</p></p>
<p><strong>I did NOT receive this book free from the publisher.  I was NOT required to write this review.  I will be purchasing copies of this book for my friends.</strong></p></p>
