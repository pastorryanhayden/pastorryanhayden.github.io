<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I recently got a Pebble Time smartwatch for my birthday and some of my friends have asked for my thoughts on it. &nbsp;So, here goes:</span></p>
<h2><b>First, why did I get a smartwatch?</b></h2><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I always wear a watch. &nbsp;I have since I was a camp counselor. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t wear it as a fashion statement, I wear it to tell the time at a glance. &nbsp;I realize many people just pull out their cell phones, but I&rsquo;ve never been able to do that - I&rsquo;ve always missed my watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife has an Apple Watch. &nbsp;Before that, she briefly had a Microsoft Band. Watching her use the Apple Watch for the last couple months, I&rsquo;ve concluded that with all it does, it&rsquo;s main function is notifications. &nbsp;Whenever she gets a phone call or text message - she can quickly see it on her wrist and either ignore it or do something about it. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I didn&rsquo;t want an Apple Watch. &nbsp;The cheapest Apple Watch would cost me $400. &nbsp;No Bueno. &nbsp;Also, I would feel ridiculously conspicuous (immodest) with an Apple Watch on my wrist. I wouldn&rsquo;t wear a $400 watch for the same reason I wouldn&rsquo;t wear a $90 tie. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t want people thinking I&rsquo;m a high roller. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, instead I got a Pebble Time. &nbsp;I like it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s no Apple Watch - but it&rsquo;s not intended to be. &nbsp;It does the main job of the Apple Watch really well. &nbsp;Here is what I can do with it:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receive notifications for phone calls, text messages, and social media.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set silent alarms and timers. (This may be my favorite feature. &nbsp;I can wake up without waking my family, set a pomodoro timer for writing, or set a timer for my steak.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Control the music playing on my phone. (This mostly comes in handy while I&rsquo;m running.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use it as a basic fitness tracker.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use it in conjunction with endomondo to watch my pacing and control what I&rsquo;m listening to while I run.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the weather at a glance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access and check off my Evernote shopping lists without pulling out my phone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access and check off my todo list (I use wunderlist) without pulling out my phone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have quick access to my daily schedule and calendar.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check sports scores and upcoming games. (The ESPN app puts this in my timeline.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell the time.</span></li><br />
</ul><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s it. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t text on it. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t use it as a Dick Tracy phone. I can&rsquo;t send my wife my heartbeat. &nbsp;About 90% of what it does is just a regular watch with notifications. </span></p>
<h2><b>What it excels at:</b></h2><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the plusses of a Pebble Time (over another smartwatch):</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">It literally costs half what an Apple Watch costs. &nbsp;It's still by far the most expensive watch I've ever owned, but it doesn't cost as much as an iPad.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s battery lasts for almost a week and takes very little time to charge. No charging it at night. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s almost always on my wrist. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s completely waterproof. &nbsp;I have worn it in the pool. &nbsp;I have worn it in the shower. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s extremely light and comfortable. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s seriously the most comfortable watch I&rsquo;ve ever worn - and I&rsquo;ve had many of them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aesthetically, it looks ok with dress clothes and casual clothes alike. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s definitely geeky looking - but I like it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is almost infinitely customizable. &nbsp;If you could imagine a watchface - someone has probably already created a free version of it.</span></li><br />
</ul></p>
<h2><b>What I don&rsquo;t like about it:</b></h2><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is what I&rsquo;m not crazy about (where the Apple watch is better):</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Answering texts or calls would be a nice feature. (Apple restricts that to sell Apple watches.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wish I had more control of the notifications that it shows. (Apple restricts that to sell Apple watches.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have to re-pair it to my iPhone often. &nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t a big deal, it takes all of twenty seconds.</span></li><br />
</ul></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion:</b></h2><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I really like it. &nbsp;I am not disapointed that I got this instead of an Apple Watch. &nbsp;I can live with the downsides. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d heartily recommend it to a friend.</span></p>
