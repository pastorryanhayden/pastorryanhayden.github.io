<p>Three weeks ago, my office was the least desireable semi-finished room on our church property. The panelled walls were a powerful neon green, the drop ceiling was a mere inches over my head, the floor was bare concrete and there were no where near enough outlets.<br />
A member of my church, Matt Pullen, decided to take it upon himself to do something about it, and though it took awhile, what I have now is an office I will be proud of for a long time to come.<br />
I absolutely love my new office. I haven't said too much about it, for fear it would come across as gloating, but I love it. It is a near perfect place for me to read and study that minimizes clutter and is easy to keep clean. It's the kind of place I would love to show off, so I am going to do it here in this post.<br />
I've listed my ten favorite things about my new office, complete with pictures and a short explanation.</p></p>
<h3>1 More Space</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_0774.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-240" title="IMG_0774" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/09/IMG_0774-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p></p>
<p>My office upstairs was less than 10 feet wide. There was barely enough room on the side of my desk to get behind it. I always felt cramped in there. By contrast, there is plenty of clean, empty space in my new office. I can comfortably meet with four people in it (so deacons meatings are covered).</p></p>
<h3>2 A closet big enough to hide the copy machine</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_0846.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-242" title="IMG_0846" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/09/IMG_0846-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p></p>
<p>We recently aquired a big copy machine/ printer. Although I love the convenience of being able to print to it and I love the money it saves over our old lazer printer, it's huge and it's kind of an eyesore. When building my new office, we literally built a closet around the copier. It's near at hand, but I don't have to look at it. Love it.</p></p>
<h3>3 Comfortable look and feel</h3></p>
<p>I like things to look natural. I'm big on earthtones and empty space. We put a natural looking tile on the floor (the basement floods sometimes, so carpet was out) and painted it a nice brown. &nbsp;In my opinion, my office is decorated in a way that is both comfortable and yet appropriate for a pastor's office.</p></p>
<h3>4 Nice looking drop ceiling and lights</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_0849.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-244" title="IMG_0849" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/09/IMG_0849-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p></p>
<p>The old drop ceiling barely cleared the door. I'm not a giant, but I'm tall enough that it made me feel a bit cramped. The new drop ceiling has been raised by six inches. We also invested in better square cieling tiles, and replaced the large rectangular florescent with a couple well placed can lights. I think it looks great.</p></p>
<h3>5 A swinging monitor arm</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_08431.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-248" title="IMG_0843" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/09/IMG_08431-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p></p>
<p>I purchased a monitor arm to attach to my desk. It frees my desk space to hold books or paper, and allows me to easily adjust the screen to show others or to increse my own comfort. I also think it looks pretty cool.</p></p>
<h3>6 A Yucca Tree</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_0844.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-249" title="IMG_0844" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/09/IMG_0844-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p></p>
<p>Being in the basement, I wanted to have something in my office that was "natural" so I bought a cool looking yucca plant. Pastor Pullen took a look at it and said "Where does he think he is, Florida?" But it makes the air in my office a little fresher and reminds me of some of my favorite places, so I'll take a little razzing and keep my tree.</p></p>
<h3>7 A big soft recliner for reading</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_0841.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-246" title="IMG_0841" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/09/IMG_0841-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p></p>
<p>The extra space in the office gave me the opportunity to have a "reading area" opposite my desk. I found an old recliner in our church's gym, cleaned it up (and sprayed it with a bug killer, just to be careful), and covered it with a cheap slip cover I bought online and I have an extremely comfortable place to do some heavy reading. It may be my favorite feature of my new office.</p></p>
<h3>8 Custom upholstered visitor seating</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_0842.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-247" title="IMG_0842" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/09/IMG_0842-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p></p>
<p>I found a set of three cool looking visitors chairs at Catholic Charities. They were purple, which I didn't care for, but really well made. So I took some extra fabric that we had laying around and (with my wifes help) reupholstered them to match the rest of the stuff in my office. I think they're really cool and I know I'm the only person with chairs like that. The coolest party, I only paid about $30 bucks for them total.</p></p>
<h3>9 Book storage</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_0845.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-250" title="IMG_0845" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/09/IMG_0845-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p></p>
<p>I'm a bibliophile, but that doesn't mean I want to look at my books all the time. Matt was kind enough to build built in bookshelfs into my office closet that can handle most of my (ink and paper) books. I now know that if I need a book, it's ten feet away, but I don't have to look at them all the time.</p></p>
<h3>10 Magic Trackpad</h3></p>
<p>I bought an Apple Magic Trackpad with some birthday money I was given and it has been one of the better technology purchases I've ever bought. I spend most of my time in sermon prep switching between reading and writing. The magic trackpad lets me scroll naturally through long text documents and quickly switch applications. On top of that, it's made the pain in my wrists from constant mouse use almost completely go away, and takes up very little space.</p></p>
<p>We've managed to make a comfortable, inexpensive office space that is a joy to work in. I'm super grateful to Matt Pullen and Mark Overmyer for the work they put into making it.</p></p>
