<p><em>This post is part of a series entitled&nbsp;<strong>"Why We Fight: A Defense of Pushing For IFB&nbsp;Reform."</strong> &nbsp;You may want to read the <a title="Why We Fight: A Defense of Pushing for IFB Reform." href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/fight-defense-pushing-ifb-reform/">introduction</a>, <a title="Why We Fight: More, Not&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; Less." href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/fight-less/">the first post,</a> and <a title="Why We Fight: The Homeowner&rsquo;s Association Theory" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/fight-homeowners-association-theory/">the second post</a> to get caught up.</em></p>
<p>Sharks are terrifying. When I was a kid, my fear of sharks made it so it took a feat of courage and willpower just to swim in an above ground pool. Whenever I was in the water, the thought of Jaws popping his toothed head up suddenly and the intimidating sound of duh-duh, duh-duh was never far from my mind. Even now, I have a healthy fear of sharks. I hear about shark attacks in places like Florida and it keeps me from venturing too far out to sea. I'm going to do my part to make sure no one has to go through life with missing appendages because they swam in waters they didn't know were full of sharks.</p>
<p><a class="fancybox" title="" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/8264758962_2eaf343872_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1456" alt="Beware of Sharks - Camps Bay (Cape Town)" src="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/8264758962_2eaf343872_o-300x274.jpg" width="300" height="274" /></a></p>
<p>So, I'm thinking about going around my area in central Illinois and posting signs that say "Beware of sharks" and "Swim with caution, sharks kill." Forget the fact that I live 200 miles from the nearest shark, and he lives in a glass tank in Chicago. Sharks are dangerous and I want people to know about them.</p>
<p>Statistically, you are about 200 times as likely to be hurt or killed by a deer as you are to be killed by a shark.&nbsp;We might not have sharks in central Illinois, but we sure have&nbsp;deer. &nbsp;If you are driving at night without paying attention, you might find out what it's like to have a deer in your lap. In the real world, Bambi is far more dangerous than Jaws.</p>
<p><a class="fancybox" title="" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Bambi_2729601564.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1457" alt="Bambi_(2729601564)" src="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Bambi_2729601564-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>I'm not opposed to warning people about sharks, it's necessary. But it makes no sense to warn people about sharks if you don't warn them about deer also. <strong>Sharks are scary, deer are cute, both are deadly. </strong></p>
<p>The people in my church (and probably the people in yours) are in very little danger of being sucked into the emergent church movement or traditional liberalism. They probably have already come to an understanding of the inerrancy of scripture, and I'd hope they believe that the Bible is the sole authority of faith and practice. Like most people, they know enough to stay away from shark infested waters.</p>
<p>The people who I minister to are far more likely to be hurt by a&nbsp;deer. By a pastor who looks innocent and who knows the answers to the right questions, but who has subtly forsaken biblical ministry. I don't meet many people who have been hurt by liberalism, the emergent church, or the charismatic movement - but there are several people in my church who have been hurt by an independent Baptist pastor with a messed up view of scripture, terrible ideas about pastoral authority, a mean spirit, or blind allegiance to some IFB crowd.</p>
<p>In the past year, I've preached against the contemporary church growth movement. I've preached a whole series of messages (as I worked through 1 Corinthians) on the dangers of the charismatic movement. Many times I've talked about the danger of churches that don't believe the Bible. I'm warning against the sharks.</p>
<p>But I also want to warn people about the more imminent&nbsp;threat. So I write, blog, and sometimes preach about the danger of forsaking biblical ministry. I write about the importance of&nbsp;biblical preaching, about the danger of man worship, and the need for a loving, non-partisan spirit. I know there are pastors who hate me for it, I know I'm a lightning rod. It may seem&nbsp;counter-intuitive - but Bambi is far more dangerous than jaws and somebody has to warn people. That's another reason why we fight.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll be wrapping this series up with a post about warning labels.</p>
