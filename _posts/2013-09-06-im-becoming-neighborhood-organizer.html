<p>One of my goals for the year is to become a better neighbor and actually befriend my neighbors. After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thoughts-Unlikely-Convert-Professors-Christian/dp/1884527388/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378479424&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=secret+thoughts+of+an+unlikely+convert"><em>"Secret Thoughts of An Unlikely Convert"</em></a> this year, I was deeply impressed that some people do not accept Christ at a front door confrontation or in a church service. There is no substitute for door to door soul winning. Yet sometimes, the only way to reach people is to let them know that you genuinely care for them. As an old preacher friend of mine often says "People don't care what you know till they know that you care."</p>
<p>So, I'm becoming a neighborhood organizer. I live in a little city, we may only have 20,000 people but it definitely has more of a city feel than a town feel. Our church is right in the middle of a tight little city neighborhood, (and the parsonage is right next door) with probably 100 houses within 100 yards of church parking lot.</p>
<p>So, I've taken it upon myself to get the neighbors together. I've started an online social network for our neighbors, I'm planning a neighborhood block party, and I've been going door to door peddling those two things and introducing myself to people. So far, people have been extremely receptive and even excited about it.</p>
<p>At the end of the month, I plan on having a neighborhood get together at my house where I can even better acquaint myself with the neighbors. I'll make some pizza in the backyard pizza oven (which probably has got me more attention from the neighbors than anything.) We'll play some yard games and hopefully make some lasting friendships.</p>
<p>Even if no one in our neighborhood ever accepts Christ because of these efforts, I want all of our neighbors to be able to say that the neighborhood is a better place because of Bible Baptist Church, and that they would hate to see it go.</p>
<p>Am I crazy? We'll see.</p>
