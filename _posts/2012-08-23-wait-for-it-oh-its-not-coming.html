<p>Sunday, the govenor of my state (Illinois Govenenor Pat Quinn) <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/14594698-418/quinn-signs-religious-tolerance-bill-at-end-of-ramadan-celebration.html">took part in Ramadan services</a> at Toyota Park in a Chicago suberb. Govenor Quinn left the park and made a public statement backing up the consitutions first ammendment and saying that religious freedom is "the most American and fundamental freedom that we have iin our country." I absolutely agree with Quinn on this (and probably only this issue.) Muslims need to have the same right to worship freely in this country as anyone else. It always irks me when I hear about a group of Christians (especially Baptist Christians who are supposed to be the champions of religious liberty) trying to stop the construction of a mosque. If we deny the religious rights of muslims, mormons or worshipers of the flying spaghetti monster, then at some point people are going to deny the right of worship to us. That being said, where is the outcry from the Illinois politicians who just weeks ago were vowing to keep Chick-fil-a out of the state. Does anybody really think that even a sizeable minority of the 15,000 muslims that Pat Quinn knelt with on Sunday are for same sex marriage? After all, adherants to their religion are still killing homosexuals in the name of religion in other parts of the world. You aren't going to hear it, because it's still politically incorrect to say anything negative about muslims. I know I've been pounding the same nail for a while, but I just saw this as another opportunity to say that it isn't religion or even an adherance to traditional morality that draws the ire of the left, it is Bible-believing Christianity.</p></p>
