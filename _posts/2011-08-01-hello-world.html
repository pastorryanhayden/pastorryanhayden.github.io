I guess I'm not cautious enough. I guess I always took those warnings about backing up your wordpress files when you update as meant for other people. Whatever my shortcomings, I just lost years worth of content and design work, all because I hit the "update" button a little too hastily. So if this website looks a little raw, I promise I will add more content in the upcoming weeks.</p></p>
