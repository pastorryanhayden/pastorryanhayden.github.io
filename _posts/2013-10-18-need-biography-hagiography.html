<p>In my last post (which was actually a chapter for a book I'm working on) I drew the ire of a few guys who thought I was wrong to bring up (what I think is the apparent) narcissistic tendencies of Jack Hyles and Frank Norris. It seems there are some independent Baptists who don't want anything negative published about past leaders.</p>
<p>Personally, I disagree with that and do so strongly. I think we need realistic biography of preachers, not hagiography (books written to make people a saint.) Unfortunately, at present, there are two types of literature available about fundamentalist leaders:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are books written only to sing their praises. These books are usually skewed to the point where no fault at all is mentioned, and give the impression that the preacher could do no wrong.</li>
<li>There are books written to criticize and have a critical agenda. These books often paint the same men as monsters, and betray a political agenda.</li><br />
</ul><br />
In my opinion, real history is somewhere between the two extremes. I think people need to know the truth, at least as much of the truth as presents itself and come to their own opinion. Here are three reasons why:</p>
<h3>Reason 1</h3><br />
As every history teach who has ever lived has said: If we don't learn from our history, we are destined to repeat it. How can we learn from a history that has been airbrushed and skewed to our side? If a man was truly great, his accomplishments and character will rise above his failures. But every man who has ever lived (save One) has had failures.</p>
<h3>Reason 2</h3><br />
When the Bible records the lives of "great" men, it doesn't gloss over their failures. We know about David's affair not because the Philistines wrote about it, but because it was chronicled by the prophets of God. Moses was still "great" despite smiting the Egyptian and smiting the rock. Abraham still wins our admiration despite lying about Sarah. John the Baptist is still great despite his depression and questioning of Jesus.</p>
<p>Imagine if scripture painted these men as faultless. Where would we go for encouragement when we fall?</p>
<h3>Reason 3</h3><br />
By not addressing the failures of people we admire, we run the risk of normalizing their behavior.</p>
<p>At the very foundation of justice is the notion that error that goes unaddressed becomes error that is accepted behavior. We also talk often about leadership being held to a higher standard. Put those two ideas together and it quickly becomes obvious that allowing established patterns of sin or foolish behavior to go unchecked just because a person has great influence is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>We didn't get where we are today by our own efforts, we acknowledge that we are standing on the shoulders of our forbears, and we are grateful for what they've done. As anyone who has ever owned an old house can tell you, however, it's wise to keep an eye out for possible needed repairs to the structure we were given from time to time. Work that may have gotten by thirty years ago could sometimes be a catastrophe if it's not corrected.</p>
