<p>Any time a preacher relies on insults and name calling to get his point across, I immediately suspect his motivation and understanding of the issue he's speaking about.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish."</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/James3%3A13-16" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">James 3:13-16</a></blockquote></p>
