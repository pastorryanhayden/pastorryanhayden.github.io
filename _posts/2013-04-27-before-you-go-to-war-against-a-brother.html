<p>I teach a Bible Survey class at a local Bible Institute. In preparation for that class this week, I&rsquo;ve been reading through Joshua. As I was reading, I found a story in <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Joshua22" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Joshua 22</a> which has amazing implications for preachers.</p>
<h2 id="joshua22"><a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Joshua22" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Joshua 22</a></h2><br />
Way back in the Deuteronomy years, Isreal had conquered some land under Moses&rsquo; direction that was east of the Jordan River. Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manassah, asked Moses for that land and Moses agreed as long as they would take part in the conquest of the rest of the land west of the Jordan. They kept their end of the bargain, and after years of fighting crossed over the Jordan to their geographically isolated home.</p>

<p>But shortly after that, the 9 and a half tribes west of Jordan heard that the eastern tribes had erected a huge altar.</p>
<p>Immediately, they prepared for war. The sting of the plagues from Israel&rsquo;s foray into Baal worship was still in memory, and they would not tolerate jews in any deviant kind of worship.</p>
<p>But, before they sent the armies, they sent a party of priests and representatives to hear the easterner&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>There was no civil war. There never was a need for one.</p>
<p>The altar was not an altar for worship and sacrifice, it certainly was not an altar to Baal, it was a memorial to remind the easterner children of what God had done for them. When the peace party heard this explained, they were o.k. with it.</p>

I also read (actually listened to while I painted) a book this week called &ldquo;Long Way Home.&rdquo; The book told the story of a 19 year old kid named Jovan Mosely. A guy from the bad parts of Chicago who witnessed a murder and was tricked/coerced into signing a confession. He waited six years for a trial and would have been sent away for life was it not for a chance encounter with a female high power defense attorney. It&rsquo;s a fascinating book (although I could have done with out the gritty street language.)</p>

<p>Mosley was never read his Miranda rights, and never told what was going on. He was chained to a wall in a six by six room for 27 hours without food, water or a bathroom break. None of the detectives wrote his statements down. He waited over a year to get a public defender who didn&rsquo;t turn out to care.</p>
<p>I saw a common thread this week in both stories and that was the importance of due process.</p>
<h2 id="dueprocess">Due Process</h2><br />
The legal system needs prosecutors and we need detectives. It needs people to police the streets and to make sure that the bad guys go to jail. It needs lawyers to prove before a court of law that the people did what they are accused of.</p>
<p>The legal system also needs defense attorneys, juries, and due process. It need a court system that is thorough, fair, and built of the presumption of innocence. It needs defense attorneys to make sure everyone gets a fair trial and procedures to make sure no one is abused before they are convicted.</p>

<h2 id="dueprocessinchurchrelations">Due Process in Church Relations</h2><br />
In a spiritual sense, we need the prosecutor side of the courtroom. We need to stand for the truth. If the 9.5 western tribes had had the same attitude towards compromise that they show in this chapter at Kadesh Barnea, or when Aaron made the golden calf, or when the Amalechites introduced Baal worship then thousands of lives would have been spared. Their desire to keep religion pure was laudable. They were <em>&ldquo;earnestly contending for the faith once delivered to the saints.&rdquo;</em> They were being spiritual prosecutors, just as we sometimes need to be.</p>
<p>But we also need to remember, in our contending for the faith, that <strong>our gut instinct is not always right</strong>. Not everything that smells of smoke is fire. It is entirely possible for us to get the motives, intentions and actions of others wrong. It&rsquo;s possible to earnestly contend with the wrong people. We need some kind of due process to balance our tendency to mark everyone off as a heretic.</p>
<p>When we hear about Christian&rsquo;s who have &ldquo;gone into compromise&rdquo; or who are &ldquo;teaching false doctrine.&rdquo; It should not be &ldquo;guilty until proven innocent&rdquo; but &ldquo;innocent until proven guilty.&rdquo; We need to get all of our facts strait before we go on attack. We cannot jump to conclusions, and then go look for data to back up our conclusions. Everybody deserves a fair trial.</p>
<p>Imagine how many innocent Hebrews would have been slain by their brothers had not they sent a party to ask questions first. Consider how many people have been hurt in fundamentalism&rsquo;s history by over zealous contenders who didn&rsquo;t have all of the facts.</p>
<p>Before we go into attack mode against a brother we must remember that <strong>the burden of proof is on the prosecutor</strong>, and we should sincerely <strong>want</strong> them to be <strong>innocent</strong>.</p>
<p>We are after converts not casualties.</p>
