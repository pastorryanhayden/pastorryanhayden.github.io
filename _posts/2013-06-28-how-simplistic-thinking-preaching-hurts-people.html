<p>There is a intellectual disease among us. A disease that does much harm. It devastates our politics, undermines our education and most seriously, it grows like a weed in our religious thinking and completely crowds out biblical balance. That disease is <strong>simplistic thinking</strong>.</p>
<p>Simplistic is not the same as simple. The dictionary defines &ldquo;simple&rdquo; as &ldquo;easily understood or done.&rdquo; &ldquo;Simplistic&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;treating complex issues and problems as if they were much simpler than they really are:&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody should aim to keep things as simple as possible. When we take truth and present it in a complex, difficult way we are doing people a great disservice. <em>&ldquo;Where there is no vision, the people perish, but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.&rdquo;</em> People need to clearly see what God&rsquo;s Word says, or else they will perish. Our spiritual eyes can only handle so much complexity.</p>

<p>When we present things simplistically, however, we aren&rsquo;t just doing people a disservice, we are fundamentally changing the truth. Think about it this way: If you add a bunch of gaudy ornaments to a Ford Truck, you might confound people and cause them to scratch their head and think &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo; But if you start going under the hood and pulling stuff out - your Ford truck will cease to work as a Ford truck. Both are potentially damaging, but <em>subtraction</em> will get you to inoperable a lot faster than <em>addition</em> will.</p>
<p>A simplistic view of scripture and the Christian life is particularly damaging. God didn&rsquo;t give us a list of slogans, He didn&rsquo;t give us a checklist, He didn&rsquo;t give us a &ldquo;plan,&rdquo; He gave us His Word. All of it. 66 books. He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;the one liners, moral checklist, or simple theological system you come up with when you read God&rsquo;s Word is given by inspiration of God&hellip;that the man of God may be perfect.&rdquo; He said <em>&ldquo;All scripture is given by inspiration of God&hellip;that the man of God may be perfect.&rdquo;</em> Then He said in Revelation don&rsquo;t add to it or subtract from it or there will be dire <em>eternal consequences</em>.</p>
<p>There are practical <em>right now consequences</em> too.</p>
<p>Take a simplistic view of salvation and you&rsquo;ll give many false assurance. Take a simplistic view of what God&rsquo;s Word says about divorce and you will hurt people every time you preach on it. Take a simplistic view of sin and you will become a self-righteous pharisee. Take a simplistic view of church leadership and you&rsquo;ll become the Lord and idol of your church.</p>
<p>So how do you avoid simplistic thinking about the Bible? In my humble opinion there is only one way:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Stick to the Bible.</strong></blockquote><br />
Don&rsquo;t preach a Bible-ish lifestyle coupled to Bible-ish doctrine. Preach the Word. Don&rsquo;t skip over it. Don&rsquo;t treat it as secondary to your preaching. Realize that God knows what He is doing and that any perceived complexity in scripture is intended and necessary.</p>
<p>Simply stated: Simplistic preaching is killing us. Let&rsquo;s refuse to do it and give people &ldquo;the Word of life&rdquo; instead.</p>
