<p>Tomorrow night, I'm going to be preaching from the passage in Leviticus 10, where Nadab and Abihu offer <em>"strange fire"</em> upon the altar and are consumed by the fire of God. As you can imagine, I'm going to take the opportunity to preach about how God wants to regulate our worship, and the danger of experimenting with what God has given. I fully intend to use the message as an opportunity to preach against the acceptance of the contemporary worship movement, novel theology, etc. It sounds like a great opportunity to throw in the buzzword "#oldpaths."</p>
<p>So it got me thinking, despite my pleas, I still have yet to see anybody define what they mean by "old paths." While both age and experience makes me probably the worst candidate for defining "old paths" I thought I'd take a crack at it anyways.</p>
<p>Before I give you my list of what the "old paths" are, I think I should say this is my list and it's a positive list. These are all things I wholeheartedly would endorse, and, if I thought #oldpaths meant these things in it's current use, I'd never say another negative thing about it.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<h2>1. Bible preaching</h2><br />
We are told in scripture to <em>"preach the word,"</em> that the early church <em>"continued in the apostles doctrine,"</em> and that they <em>"ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ."</em> If we are going to be #oldpaths, we have got to be biblical.</p>
<p>My pastor in college, Clarence Sexton, used to say all the time "nothing is spiritual unless it is biblical" and "we need a revolution back to the Bible."</p>
<p>More than any other old path, I think this one is important because it informs all of the rest. If you replace Bible preaching with the preacher's ideas or preaching to the supposed needs of the people, in short order you can lose the rest of these #oldpaths.</p>
<h2>2. Preaching for conviction</h2><br />
Not only must our preaching be biblical in order to be #oldpaths, I think it should be convictional. We should preach regularly for action. We should preach expecting change.</p>
<p>The preaching of Jesus, Peter, and Paul as well as the preaching of the Old Testament prophets was this kind of preaching. It's not enough that people just know the Bible, they must become <em>"doers of the law, and not hearers only."</em> In order for this to happen, we should preach as a dying man to dying men, earnestly trying to bring the importance of obeying the truth to the minds of and hearts or our hearers.</p>
<h2>3. Evangelistic zeal</h2><br />
A third #oldpath, that is often forsaken is evangelistic zeal. Too often, we lose the urgency that the great commission dictates. We should earnestly desire to have Paul's testimony of having a conscience clear of all men, and be faithful in preaching the gospel to as many as possible by every means possible.</p>
<h2>4. Reverential, truth filled worship</h2><br />
Worship in the scripture was reverential based on the truth of the scriptures. In many cases, modern contemporary worship is a casual affair and the message of many of the modern worship songs pays little more than lip service to the great truths of the gospel. How much better that we stay on the #oldpath of singing <em>"psalms, hymns and spiritual songs."</em> Nothing is less #oldpaths than trading hundreds of years of Christian hymnody for "worship music" whose greatest asset is contemporaneity.</p>
<h2>5. Respectable and modest clothing</h2><br />
The old testament priests had special clothes set apart for the worship of God and Christians throughout history have understood the importance of "church clothes." At the very least, we should understand that the clothing we wear when coming to worship should be respectful and appropriate to the occasion. If you would feel conspicuously underdressed wearing your church clothes at a funeral or a wedding, then they probably aren't #oldpaths. (Of course, we are speaking of church members, not visitors or occasional attenders.)</p>
<p>We also recognize that modesty and gender identity in clothing are Bible principles that have been recognized by Christians of all ages.</p>
<h2>6. Ecclesiastical Separation</h2><br />
The Bible commands us to <em>"mark those which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them."</em> Our churches should be #oldpaths, in that they are obedient to this principle. We should especially be careful to separate ecclesiastically from churches preaching another gospel.</p>
<h2>7. Personal Holiness</h2><br />
When God commanded <em>"Be ye holy for I am holy"</em> it was a continuing command for all ages. Personal holiness is not the emphasis of overactive and overzealous preachers of generations past, it is not a puritanical influence we should put behind us, it is a timeless requirement of God for His church. If you never emphasize personal holiness, you are not #oldpaths.</p>
<h2>8. Identification with Christians of the past</h2><br />
Christianity is a treasured heritage, not a contemporary experiment. All of us who know Christ are running our race with a great cloud of witnesses from times past cheering us on. Any movement that finds of believers that finds its identify with a small subset of contemporary Christians more than the great heritage of the church from ages past is a movement that is probably truly not on the #oldpaths. If we marry the spirit of the age, we will soon be a widower, how much better for us to identify with the scarlet cord of Bible believing Christians running through history.</p>
<h2>9. Missions</h2><br />
The New Testament church was a missionary sending, missionary supporting church concerned with seeing the gospel spread and churches planted throughout the whole world. If we would truly be #oldpaths, we should be missions minded as well.</p>
<h2>10. Multi-generational Ministry</h2><br />
The book of Titus implores the aged man and aged women to instruct the young men and young women. When we see the church in the New Testament and the church throughout history, we do not see the collection of one age group, but a church made up of people spanning generations. Church should not be so geared towards one generation, (i.e. young people) that it becomes unwelcome to another. We need people of all ages.</p>
<p>This list is just a partial/working list of what I think the true #oldpaths are. If you have something you'd add to the list, let me know in the comments.</p>
