<h1 id="becautious.">Be Cautious.</h1><br />
When I was in 5th grade, I spent close to a year living in the basement of my stepfather&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s house (my Grampy.) While the living arrangements weren&rsquo;t cool, I didn&rsquo;t mind. Grampy built a makeshift hockey rink in the backyard for his hockey obsessed grandson (me) and either my stepfather or his brother, both accomplished hockey players, would give me skating and hockey lessons every day. When the weather warmed up, I would lace up my rollerblades and skate to the next street over, where my stepfather&rsquo;s cousin, who was playing for the Boston Bruins at the time, lived. It&rsquo;s sounds corny now, but I just wanted to meet him. I must have done this dozens of times.</p>
<p>One day as I rode up their street, I saw a bunch of news trucks and a crowd in the house next to my stepdad&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s house. It turns out that the man who lived in that house, a man whose front door I skated past almost every day, had been using an early form of the internet to lure, rape, and even kill 10&ndash;13 year old boys. Seeing as I was about 11 at the time, it was quite the wake up call.</p>

<p>The internet has always had it&rsquo;s own dangers. Information or pictures that may seem totally harmless to us could be maliciously valuable to the wrong kind of people. Viruses, scammers, con-men, and pedophiles are all there, waiting for their opportunity.</p>
<p>But the internet poses another kind of danger that is rarely talked about. The internet is a gold mine for people looking to misrepresent and incriminate you. Quotes can be lifted out of context. Your name and testimony can be ruined. It happens more often than you would think.</p>
<p>In order to protect your testimony on the internet, you need to be very cautious about what you post.</p>
<h2 id="rememberthatanybodycanseewhatyoupost.">Remember that anybody can see what you post.</h2><br />
If you operate on the assumption that the only people who will ever read your blog are a small faithful community, you are wrong. Once you hit publish on Facebook, Tweet or hit Publish, then your words of wisdom are &ldquo;out there&rdquo; for everyone to see.</p>
<p>In a way that&rsquo;s great, because you can influence people you&rsquo;ve never met (my online sermons are listened to by people as far away as Saudi Arabia every month) but do you really want everybody to people you don&rsquo;t know (and who may not know Christ) to read your rant about black Bibles vs. brown Bibles? Or that the waiter at the local IHOP didn&rsquo;t give you good service?</p>
<h2 id="rememberthatyourpostispermanent.">Remember that your post is permanent.</h2><br />
One time years ago when I was a teacher, I was having a particularly rough day, and I posted about it on my Facebook wall. Water under the bridge, right? Well almost two years later (that&rsquo;s decades in digital time) a parent brought the post up to use against me. I learned a lesson that day that things you post on Facebook or Twitter never really die.</p>
<p>Last week Loui Giglio was in the news because some internet folks dug up a strong message against homosexuality (they&rsquo;d find lots on mine if they looked) that He had preached 15 years ago. The point is once it&rsquo;s out there, it&rsquo;s out there, and it could come back to haunt you later.</p>
<h2 id="rememberthatyourpostcanspreadevenfasterthanwordofmouthandmaymeansomethingdifferenttoitsnewaudience.">Remember that your post can spread even faster than word of mouth (and may mean something different to it&rsquo;s new audience.)</h2><br />
A few months ago, when it came out that Jack Schaap was in an abusive, immoral relationship with a 16 year old girl, lots of people jumped onto their blogs to write about it. Many people saw it as an opportunity to gloat. Some felt the need to defend him. Most of the Independent Baptists did neither. But what many of them did do is to label it as &ldquo;an affair&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that most of the people who did that were not purposely trying to downplay what Schaap did. In most cases they were discussing this to an audience of pastors in the context of the IFB movement. They just used the first term that came to them. That&rsquo;s not how the media or evangelical bloggers saw it, however. There was widespread outcry on the internet over this &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; language and many people said &ldquo;where is the remorse over the victim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This should serve as a reminder to us that our posts can and will be read by unintended audiences. There are websites whose sole purpose is to hunt out our mistakes and parade them before the world so that they can mock us. Those websites get a lot more traffic than mine does. It&rsquo;s not traffic that I want.</p>
<p>While we can never completely protect ourself from misrepresentation, we can be aware that it happens and careful not to give others the ammunition that they shoot at us.</p>
