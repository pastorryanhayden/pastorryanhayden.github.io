<p>While I was in college, on a date with my soon to be wife, we dropped into a used bookstore in Chattanooga, TN. While looking through the religious books, I picked up a copy of a book by Charles Spurgeon&nbsp;that I hadn't heard of before entitled <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Greatest-Fight-World-Ambassador/dp/1840300604/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331657437&amp;sr=8-7">The Greatest Fight in the World</a></em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/iu.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1800 size-medium" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/iu-199x300.jpg" alt="iu" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Annually, Charles Spurgeon would gather the graduates from his Pastor's College and give them a lecture on something that was important to him and that he thought would be useful for their ministries. This book was the transcript of the last such lecture he ever gave.</p>
<p><strong>I am and was a Spurgeon fanboy</strong>. The fact that Spurgeon wrote the book was enough to get me to read it with interest. But this book was entitled <em>The Greatest Fight in the World</em> and that it was sort of his parting address to preachers. I was <em>going</em> to get it and I was <em>going</em> to read it.</p>
<p>Around this same time, I was reading in my personal devotions the first part of 2 Peter and was enthralled with the phrase</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of Him who hath called you to glory and virtue. . .Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises . . ."</em></blockquote><br />
That this was in the back of my mind was the best preparation possible for what I would read in that book.</p>
<p>Things like:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The scriptures in their own sphere are like God in the universe - All-sufficient. In them is revealed all the light and power the mind of man can need in spiritual things."</blockquote><br />
and</p>
<blockquote><p>"We need nothing more than God has seen fit to reveal."</blockquote><br />
and</p>
<blockquote><p>"I can have no wish to preach at all if I may not continue to expound the subjects which I find in these pages. What else is worth preaching? Brethren, the truth of God is the only treasure for which we seek, and the Scripture is the only field in which we dig for it."</blockquote><br />
In short, <em>The Greatest Fight in the World</em> is, among other things, a treatise on the place of the Bible in the ministry. It was my first real exposure, outside of my Bible reading, to the idea of <strong>"the sufficiency of scripture"</strong>. To say it made a big impact on me would be an understatement. This idea, championed by Spurgeon in this book (and I would find by many others) has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed my view of preaching.</li>
<li>Steered my ideas about the meaning of worship.</li>
<li>Caused me to be skeptical about much of what goes on in fundamentalism.</li>
<li>Opened my mind to so many truths.</li>
<li>Heightened my study of scripture.</li><br />
</ul><br />
In ministry, the idea that scripture is sufficient keeps me from getting discouraged when things in church don't go well. It helps me focus on long term health not short term results. It gives me confidence that I can plan a long Bible teaching series and God's word will take care of our church. In short, it lets me relax and removes the temptation to think that the pastorate is all about me.</p>
<p>If you've never read it, I recommend it to you. I promise you'll find it wholly relevant to what is going on today.</p>
