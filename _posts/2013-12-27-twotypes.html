<p>I've been reading a book this week about the conflicts between Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Debate-Edmund-Burke-Thomas-ebook/dp/B00BKRW4Z6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388161356&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+great+debate+edmund+burke+thomas+paine+and+the+birth+of+right+and+left">The Great Debate.</a> It's a fascinating study on how the conflicting ideas of these two men, both at one time viewed as "revolutionaries" have become the ideological basis for the modern right/left divide in western politics.</p>
<p>One of the things that I found interesting is that in late 18th century England (at least in my limited understanding of it) there were two types of conservatives. There where the conservative Tories, who showed a kind of blind allegiance to the crown and there where what became known as the "conservative Whigs" who believed in the British system of government as it stood yet believed it should be both accountable and improving. A third group emerged at the time, which became called "the new whigs" or "Jacobins" which basically had no respect at all for the British standing order and wanted to start over.</p>
<p>Confused yet?? Me too.</p>
<p>Here's my point: Just like the government of 1780s England, I think independent Baptists are going through a party line readjustment right now and, just like in 1780s England, there are at least two types of conservatives.</p>
<h3>1. There are conservatives whose allegiance is to the people and institutions of the the independent Baptist movement.</h3><br />
These are the guys who rush to defend any allegation against independent Baptists. They are the ones who seem ready to run you up a pole at any mention of generational change or any mention of the possible mis-emphasis of earlier generations. These are the guys who rush to defend leaders of the past with "how dare you"s.</p>
<p>They are conservatives who are trying to conserve the <em>status quo</em>. They seem to see "independent baptistness" as their inherently virtuous sacred charge, and are ready to call a duel with anybody who would impugn it's honor.</p>
<h3>2. There are conservatives whose allegiance is to the principles and purpose of the independent Baptist movement.</h3><br />
These guys are independent Baptists and know why they are independent Baptists. They believe in the independence of the local church, in ecclesiastical separation, in contending for the faith once delivered to the saints, etc.. They are both acutely aware of and grateful for their heritage as independent Baptists. They know they are standing on the shoulders of others.</p>
<p>But, (and here is the crucial difference between them and the first group), they realize that there is a often a difference between a group's principles and a group's practice and that constantly correcting that difference is essential to being a conservative. They do not see it as their job as conservatives to take what was given to them as a blind charge and pass it on unchanged to the next generation, but to take what's been given to them and make sure they pass on something consistent with it's principles and purpose.</p>
<h3>When it comes to Independent Baptists, it's not about left and right.</h3><br />
Recently, someone accused me of being part of "the left" among independent Baptists and said that their crowd was "the right." I wanted to say "really?? Left of who?" You can go through your "standards" and I guarantee I could check of 95% or more of them. The other pastors in town tell people I'm a legalist too. I came up in the same school as you did, and was never marked off as a troublemaker. Who am I left of?</p>
<p>I'll see your standards and raise you some. I have a standard that preachers should preach the Word with obvious regard to how God gave it. I have a standard that men shouldn't be gloried in. I have a standard that the gospel shouldn't be reduced and that talk of sin and holiness should be gospel-centric. I have a standard that bullies, charlatans and narcissists should be barred from our pulpits. I have a standard that theological error and differences should be dealt with fairly and thoroughly rather than be given a simplistic drive-by treatment.</p>
<p>Does that make your crowd to the left of mine?</p>
<p>No...</p>
<p>We are both conservatives...</p>
<p>We are just conserving different things.</p>
