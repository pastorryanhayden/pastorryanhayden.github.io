<p>Tomorrow night, as a part of my ongoing Bible study in Leviticus, I&rsquo;m going to be teaching on Leviticus 17. Most of Leviticus 17 seems to be a cut and dry command that the <strong>only</strong> place sacrifices are to be made is in the tabernacle. Consider these verses:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp, And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:&rdquo;</em> (Leviticus 17:3-4)</p>
<p><em>&rdquo;And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice, And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the Lord; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.&rdquo;</em> (Leviticus 17:8-9)</blockquote><br />
Pretty clear right? The only place where it is acceptable to offer a burnt offering or a sacrifice is the Tabernacle. &nbsp;Hard and fast rule.</p>
<p>Only it isn&rsquo;t. Because that explanation doesn&rsquo;t jive with the rest of scripture.</p>
<p>Consider Deuteronomy 12:13-14</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest: But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
Then you have the Ed incident in Joshua 22 (although that wasn't for sacrifice), and numerous incidents in the historical books where prophets or kings offered burnt offerings or sacrifices in places other than the tabernacle (Deuteronomy 27:5, Gideon and Menoah in Judges, Samuel at Gilgal, Samuel at Bethlehem, David at Bethlehem, Elijah on Mount Carmel, etc.) and God seemed to be pleased with it.</p>
<p>What gives?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t offer a solid explanation for Leviticus 17 yet, &nbsp;<em><strong>but it has reminded me of these truths of Bible study:</strong></em></p>
<h2>When dealing with God&rsquo;s commands, it&rsquo;s absolutely important that you study the scriptures on more than a surface level.</h2><br />
There are many commands in scripture that, taken on a surface level, make for some good preaching. I mean, as you read them they seem like perfect sin arrows tailor-made for your next barn stormer. Let her rip.</p>
<p>Often, our zeal can get in the way of what the passage is actually saying, and can cause some real problems. Study what it was like to live in Pharisee dominated Israel. They had hundreds of surface level interpretations for things like the sabbath law, Jesus showed time and again they were way off and they were repressing people. We don&rsquo;t want to do the same thing.</p>
<h2>When dealing with God&rsquo;s commands, whatever interpretation you come to has to take all of scripture into account.</h2><br />
In Leviticus we have a command against sacrifices anywhere but the tabernacle, in Deuteronomy a place would be set ups here God directed. Both are God&rsquo;s Word. You can cherry pick passages on many surface issues and &ldquo;go to seed&rdquo; on them, totally neglecting the nuance provided by other parts of God&rsquo;s Word. We have to recognize that that is dangerous.</p>
<p>For example, consider the topic of divorce. Whenever we talk about divorce, we tend to go to Jesus&rsquo; teaching on it because it is the strongest teaching on it. But if you believe in an inerrant Bible, you have to temper Jesus&rsquo; teaching on it with what Paul says about it in 1 Corinthians and what Moses says about it in Deuteronomy. Those are both God&rsquo;s Word too.</p>
<p>If we just take Jesus&rsquo;s word on it without looking at what Paul and Moses taught, it&rsquo;s possible to come up with position on divorce that may get the sin part right, but is overly harsh and repressive for divorced people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one example, we could apply the same thinking to other issues as well.</p>
<h2>When dealing with God&rsquo;s commands, you&rsquo;ve got to keep progressive revelation in mind.</h2><br />
God sometimes gives a command at one point in history, and then reverses the command later on. Anybody not eating pork? Anybody circumcising their kids on the eighth day?</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s Word is authoritative, absolutely, but it&rsquo;s also progressive and what God says in Revelation has more bearing on us than what He says in Genesis.</p>
<h2>When dealing with God&rsquo;s commands, stricter is not always better.</h2><br />
The stricter interpretation of the sabbath was the one taken by the Pharisees, not the one taken by Jesus. The stricter way of looking at the Old Testament was way the Judaizers looked at it, not the way Paul looked at it.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, it&rsquo;s absolutely possible to be stricter than God, and when we do, we are doing just as much harm as if we are less strict than God, because we are misrepresenting Him to the world and placing burdens on people God never intended them to bear.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m getting at is this&hellip;</p>
<h2>Nuance is not a dirty word.</h2><br />
God sometimes draws with some pretty dark lines in scripture, but then goes and fills in those lines with shades of gray and white. We are not doing God any favors if we only focus on the black. How much better to step back, take the whole thing into account, and see the beautiful picture that God has made for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not our job to darken God&rsquo;s grays or lighten God&rsquo;s blacks. It&rsquo;s our job to faithfully present all of scripture. If we do anything less, we are misrepresenting God.</p>
