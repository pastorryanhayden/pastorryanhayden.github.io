<p>I've been blogging and writing for a little over a year now and it's amazing at how fast it's snowballed. Even though I've tried very hard to stick to principles and to refrain from attacking people, I've been told that I'm a "polarizing figure." While most of the feedback I get is very positive and encouraging (I get encouraging phone calls or emails all the time) I've also heard my fair share of criticism.</p>
<p>That's ok. I knew when I started this that I was putting a target on my back. I knew that it would close doors. I knew that it would be misunderstood. I knew it would draw criticism. Criticism is just part and parcel of being any kind of leader.</p>
<p>The criticism I get most of the time is very predictable. It falls into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, critics attack me personally and question my motives. (bitterness, lack of standards, calling me a "neo" or a compromiser, etc.)</li>
<li>Second, critics talk about results and question my effectiveness. (I had sixteen people saved last Sunday in my church, how about you?, Just shut up and work, etc.)</li>
<li>Third, critics invoke some IFB hero who took a different stand and move on. (Jack Hyles didn't do it that way, John R. Rice would be rolling over in his grave, etc.)</li><br />
</ul><br />
<strong>None of these tactics have anything to do with the validity of ideas.</strong> In other words, what very few people who disagree with me have done is try to make a biblical or historical case that what I have been saying is wrong.</p>
<p>So what do they have a problem with? Far and away the biggest thing that I've done to ruffle their feathers is question the legacy of Jack Hyles and Frank Norris. But if you were to put that aside, the thing most of the critics seem to have a problem with is that someone would be critical of the IFB movement in the first place.</p>
<p>So this week (I'm on vacation) I'm going to answer that criticism. I'm going to give four reasons why I choose to fight against the excesses of the IFB movement, and why I think you should too.</p>
