<p><i>On Sunday mornings, I post my sermon manuscript here. I write three of these every week, and they are intended primarily for me, so often they have spelling and grammar errors. &nbsp;I post them here in the hopes that you can use them.</i><br> <br>Take your Bibles with me and turn to Ephesians 4. Ephesians 4.<br>For several months last year, we worked our way through the first half of the book of Ephesians and we talked about &ldquo;the Unsearchable Riches of Christ.&rdquo; Today, we are going to pick up where we left off but you are going to see that this book takes a sudden turn in a totally different direction.</p>
<p>Everything we&rsquo;ve looked at so far has been about <strong>what God did for us</strong> in our salvation, how he gave us a new nature, adopted us into His family, and made us a part of the church. From this point on, in the book of Ephesisans, it&rsquo;s about <strong>what we are supposed to do because of what God has done for us</strong>. </p>
<p>Let me tell you, you can go through every teaching book of the New Testament and you&rsquo;ll see this - you&rsquo;ll see what God has done for us and you&rsquo;ll see what God expects from us. God has saved us, He has made us new, and now because of that, we should live as new people. </p>
<p>Let me remind you of a basic truth of the scriptures church - Salvation is not just a &ldquo;get out of hell free card.&rdquo; Salvation is not just about us being free from eternal punishment. It&rsquo;s not us winning a free one way ticket to heaven.</p>
<p>No. Salvation is Jesus saving us from our sins. The New Testament starts with this declaration and it just keeps going with it. God has saved us, not so that we can go on living like the world, but so that we can be different. He has made us salt and light. He has given us a new nature. God expects us to live different. To walk different. To &ldquo;walk worthy&rdquo; as we were looking at recently, <em>&ldquo;walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called.&rdquo;</em> </p>
<p>That is not what saves us, it&rsquo;s what we were saved for. It is a part of salvation, because we were saved to be free from our sins, we were saved to walk worthy.</p>
<p>So now we come to where the rubber meets the road. By the way, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to be calling the next several messages in Ephesians &ldquo;Where the rubber meets the road.&rdquo; Here we come to brass tacks. Here is where push comes to shove. Here is where we get serious. Because all of that was leading to this.</p>
<p>If someone were to come to you tomorrow at work and ask the question: How is a Christian supposed to live? What would be your answer?</p>
<p>I want to tell you you&rsquo;ll find no better answer than what we see here in Ephesians 4.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look this morning at just one verse of it. Ephesians 4:25. This is how it starts off:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;<a href="">Eph 4:25 KJV</a> 25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>So Paul is about to give us this great list of practical Christian commands, he&rsquo;s about to tell us how we can put off the old man and put on the new man, and he starts with a very simple command:</p>
<p>Put away lying. Stop lying and start telling the truth.</p>
<p>Now for some of you, you might think, of all the things to start this list - lying?? Is lying that big of a deal? Is it that big of a problem?</p>
<p>The Bible answer to that is yes. Absolutely. Now I want to give you three points this morning about lying, and we&rsquo;ll trace these three points through scripture. First, lying is the defining characteristic of the old man. Second, truth telling is the defining characteristic of the new man, and third, honesty is essential to the church.</p>
<p><strong>So let&rsquo;s pray, and we&rsquo;ll go through those:</strong></p>
<p>Put off the old man, put on the new man. Start living like a Christian. Step number 1: stop lying.</p>
<p>Why? Why lying? Number 1:</p>
<p>1. Lying is the defining characteristic of the old man.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In other words, there is nothing more natural for a lost man than a lie. His whole world is built on lies and he lies as naturally as breathing. </p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a bold statement about billions of people, so let me back it up with the scripture. </p>
<p>The old man (Us before we were saved) and lying are usually tied together in scripture. Here in Ephesians the very first command about putting off the old man is stop lying. There is another passage that talks about the old man, in the book of Colossians 3:9 it says this:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>So, do you see it again, lying and the old man. In 1 Timothy 1 Paul is talking about the right use of the law and He says, basically, that the right use of the law is for lost people. But notice how he says it in 1 Timothy 1:9-10</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;<a href="">1Ti 1:9-10 KJV</a> 9 Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 10 For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>He get&rsquo;s through this list of sins and right at the end of it he gives us two things that basically amount to lying: liars and perjured persons. They are lost people.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21 it&rsquo;s talking about who is going to go to hell - lost people, and this is what it says:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>Notice <strong>&ldquo;and all liars.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Church, I&rsquo;ll say it again, there is no more clear cut defining characteristic of lost people, of the old man, than lying. Lying. </p>
<p>Now, where does this come from? Where did Paul get the idea (besides from the Holy Ghost) that lying was the characteristic of the Old Man. Let me give you a couple of thoughts:</p>
<p>The original sin was a lie.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember, in Genesis 3, the devil came to Eve and beguiled her, he came to her subtly. He came to her and whispered a false narrative in her ear. &ldquo;God doesn&rsquo;t love you, God&rsquo;s not looking out for your best interest. God is just using you and you&rsquo;d be better off without Him. Eat this fruit and you&rsquo;ll know, you&rsquo;ll be as gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remember. What was that? It was a lie. It was a lie. And let me tell you church, every ill, every sickness, every crooked politician that keeps his people hungry while he lives in luxury, every heartbreaking broken family, every injustice - all of it started with that one lie.</p>
<p>Another thought&hellip; </p>
<p>The devil who controls most of the world is above all things a liar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You say, &ldquo;Pastor, where do you get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, look with me at John 8. John 8. In John 8:44-45 Jesus is preaching to the Pharisees and they are mocking Him. They said &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t born of fornication like you.&rdquo; They mocked His birth. And this is what Jesus said in response:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;<a href="">Jhn 8:44-45 KJV</a> 44 Ye are of <a href="">your</a> father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. 45 And because I tell <a href="">you</a> the truth, ye believe me not.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>Notice what it says about Satan - <em>&ldquo;He abode not in the&rdquo;</em>&hellip;what? Because there is no truth in him. He is a liar by nature, and because you are controlled by him, you won&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Jesus was saying. Church, the devil is the prince and the power of the air. He&rsquo;s the one who, at least in some sense, is pulling the strings down here, and He is a liar, and those who follow him are liars.</p>
<p>One more thought, and this one I think hits a little closer to home&hellip; </p>
<p>Lost people live for things that are lies. (1 John 2:15)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Right above our text verse, when it first mentions the old man it says:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>In 1 John 2 the Apostle tells us everything that is in this world system, everything that the people around us are living for - and do you know what? They are all lies. They are illusive dreams - the lust of the flesh - man, if I can just do&hellip;this&hellip;then I&rsquo;ll be happy. The lust of the eyes. If I can just have this&hellip;then I&rsquo;ll be happy. The pride of life. If I can just be recognized for this, or if I can just get this position&hellip; then I&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>
<p>Church, that is what makes the world around us tick. That&rsquo;s what they live for. Every single commercial that is effective is playing to one of those three things. They are the theme of every movie, every pop song. Just do this, just get this, just be this and then, then you&rsquo;ll be satisfied.</p>
<p>Church, do you know what that is&hellip;it&rsquo;s a lie. The people around us, they base their life on a lie. And when one lie doesn&rsquo;t satisfy, they move on to the next one, and the next one, and the next one.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all one big lie. And that&rsquo;s the foundation. </p>
<p>If you tune your ears to hear it, you can see lies everywhere. Open Facebook and scroll through someone&rsquo;s timeline - lies. They don&rsquo;t really look like that. Really. No. A little bit of exaggeration here, a little bit of photoshopping there, only showing one side of things. It&rsquo;s all a subtle lie.</p>
<p>You go to a family party and everyone smiles and glad hands each other and yucks it up around the dinner table and then as soon as they get in the car or they think cousin bob isn&rsquo;t around &ldquo;Did you see what he was wearing, I couldn&rsquo;t believe the gift he brought.&rdquo; It is all a delicate lie, you see. Lies. </p>
<p>So point number 1 is that there is nothing more characteristic of the lost world than lying.</p>
<p>Point number 2 is&hellip; </p>
<p>2. Truth telling is the defining characteristic of the new man.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you were to look back over Ephesians 4 it&rsquo;s making an argument that we shouldn&rsquo;t be like the lost world, and the reason it says we shouldn&rsquo;t be like the lost world is because the lost world is based upon a lie, and the Christian world is based upon the truth.</p>
<p>We, as believers were people who lived in darkness, but we have seen the light. We were living in the ignorance of a clouded mind, separated from God, but we have been made over in the truth in Jesus.</p>
<p>The godless life is built upon a lie.</p>
<p>The Christian life is built upon truth.</p>
<p>One of the things we see about Jesus is that Jesus is called many times &ldquo;the truth.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;I am the way, THE TRUTH, and the life.&rdquo; John says &ldquo;Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Probably no verse in the Bible is clearer on this than 1 John 5:20</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>So look - we&rsquo;ve just learned that the lost world is based upon the lie of the original sin, led by a lying devil and directed through deceitful lying lusts - But we as believers - we <em>&ldquo;are in Him that is true. we are in the true God.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Are you seeing it?</p>
<p>John 14:17 refers to the Holy Ghost as <em>&ldquo;the spirit of Truth that is in us.&rdquo;</em> We are in Christ - the truth, and we have the Spirit of truth in us.</p>
<p>Jesus said in John 8:33 <em>&rdquo;And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free&rdquo;</em> That&rsquo;s us. We are people who have seen the light, we&rsquo;ve seen the truth, and we don&rsquo;t walk in darkness any more.</p>
<p>So listen church, the defining characteristic of our life in Christ should be truth. We shouldn&rsquo;t be habitual liars. We shouldn&rsquo;t go around lying - because our very life is based on truth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to say that if you are a person who habitually lies - I mean, that&rsquo;s a clear pattern in your life - then you should check your salvation - because we are supposed to be people of the truth.</p>
<p>If you are someone who is always being pulled in one way or another with the lies of the world - check yourself - we are supposed to be people of the truth.</p>
<p>As believers who are living as a new man, we&rsquo;ve got to come to the place where we trade the lies of the world for the Truth of God&rsquo;s word. We also need to come to the place where we trade lying for telling the truth.</p><br />
<hr>
<p>Now all of this brings me to our third point. If you look back at our text it says:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;<a href="">Eph 4:25 KJV</a> 25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>I want you to notice the last phrase - for we are members one of another.</p>
<p>Now, this is talking about the church. We know this because we are not members one of another with the lost world - the Bible teaches we are totally different from the lost world - but all over the new testament it uses this idea of members, or body parts, for the church.</p>
<p>This brings me to our last point this morning:</p>
<p>3. Truth is absolutely essential to the church.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1 Timothy 3:15 says</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>&rdquo;But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.&rdquo;</em></p><br />
</blockquote>
<p>The church is called &ldquo;the pillar and ground of the truth.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s our job. We hold up and support the truth. We stand for truth. We hold out the truth so that it can make others free. </p>
<p>Earlier in our text chapter it says that we are to be <em>&ldquo;speaking the truth in love&rdquo;</em> so that we can grow up together in Christ.</p>
<p>The church is all about the truth.</p>
<p>And here it says &ldquo;stop lying, start speaking truth, because we are members one of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, do you know what that means? That means that, if we are all a part of the same body, if we are all body parts of the same church body, when you lie to another church member - you are only hurting yourself.</p>
<p>I mean, can you cut your arm and not hurt yourself? Can you poke your eye and not hurt yourself? No, every part is interconnected, and when we lie or withhold the truth, we are only hurting ourself. We are damaging the church.</p>
<p>The church is supposed to be a place where different people can come together. Where we can have true fellowship. The only way we can do that is if we are basing it on the truth. If we are just sort of dealing with it - then that&rsquo;s nor real fellowship.</p>
<p>Truth telling is essential to the church.</p>
<p>The world manipulates - but the church is based on truth. The world covers for itself - the church is based on truth. The world pulls strings - but the church is based on truth. The world exaggerates - but the church is based on truth.</p>
<p>Listen, when you start introducing anything but the Truth, the pure unadulterated truth into the way you handle your interactions in the church, then it&rsquo;s like taking a big hatchet and whacking at your own foot. You are hurting your own body parts. Tell the truth.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p></p>
<p>In conclusion this morning I want to ask two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you a person who struggles with the truth, who struggles with lying? Maybe this morning you&rsquo;ve realized that this is totally opposed to Christianity. Will you say with me this morning &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a person of the truth.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maybe this morning none of this makes sense, because you are still in darkness, you are still living in as the old man, but you want it to. Maybe you&rsquo;ve been putting off trusting in Jesus. Why not accept Christ today? Why not be saved today?</li><br />
</ul>
<p>In a minute Brother Harold is going to come and lead us in a song of invitation. Will you take whatever step the spirit is leading you to do this morning.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>Let&rsquo;s stand for prayer.</em></strong></p><br></p>
