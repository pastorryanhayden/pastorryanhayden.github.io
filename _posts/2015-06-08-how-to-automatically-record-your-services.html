<p><em>O.k. I thought this was too cool not to share:</em></p>
<p>Have you ever not been able to post the audio recording of your sermon because a sound guy forgot to hit "record." Have you ever struggled to teach people how to use audacity, garage band or a similar program? Have you ever struggled to get a sermon onto your computer so you could back it up? I've dealt with all of those things&nbsp;many times. As a pastor in a small church, the sound thing doesn't come easy.</p>
<p>Then, last week I was looking into software to record interviews for a podcast I'm working on (more on that later) and I purchased a program called Audio Hijack 3.</p>
<h3>Audio Hijack 3</h3><br />
Essentially, <a href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/">Audio Hijack 3</a> is an app for recording system audio. If you've ever wanted to, for instance, record the music from a YouTube video and turn it into an mp3 (not that&nbsp;would be ethical), you would use Audio Hijack for that. I can use it to record facetime audio or Skype calls, enabling me to do interviews with people over the phone.</p>
<p>As I was playing around with it, I realized it would be a good simple tool for the sound guy to use to record the sermons. The interface is much less scary looking than Audacity or Garageband. So I was considering giving it a try...</p>

<p>But then I saw a button labeled "schedule" and thought "what does this do?" It turns out, you can instruct Audio Hijack to automatically turn itself on and record audio say from 11:15am-12:00pm every Sunday morning (see the screenshot below). You can set up as many recurring automatic records as you want. You can also instruct the program to always raise the volume level, convert the file to an easily downloadable mp3 and save the file with a handy naming convention in the folder of your choice.&nbsp;<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2169" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-08-at-10.26.31-AM-300x181.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-08 at 10.26.31 AM" width="300" height="181" /></p>
<h3>Cloud Storage</h3><br />
When you set up a shared Dropbox, Google Drive, or Onedrive folder on the sound booth computer, it gets even more interesting. You just set Audio Hijack to save the scheduled MP3 in your shared folder of choice(assuming that folder is also on your personal computer) and whala! You now automatically have a neat MP3 of your sermon audio on your computer 5 minutes after the service is over..</p>

" width="300" height="171" /></a> Here is the audio folder in OneDrive that Audio Hijack sends the sermons to.[/caption]</p>
<p>You just have to open the file, trim off all of the non-sermony parts, and save it and it's ready to go live on your website. (Rogue Amoeba, the company who makes Audio Hijack, also makes a neat little audio editing tool called <a href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com/fission/">Fission</a> which is great for that.)</p>

<p>In other words, this program can do 90% of what a small church sound guy does with no human error. Your sound guy can now worry about the sound board and the rest is history.</p>
<p>The catch(es). The program only works on a mac. (Our sound booth computer is an older iMac that we bought used for a hundred bucks.) and the program costs $50.</p>
<p>I'm guessing there are a lot of pastors out their that think having a reliable way to get their sermons online is worth more than $50.</p>
