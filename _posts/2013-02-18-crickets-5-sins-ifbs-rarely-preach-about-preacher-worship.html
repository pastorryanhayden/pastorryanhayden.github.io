<p>This is the second post in the series &ldquo;Crickets: Five Sins Independent Baptists Rarely Preach About.&rdquo; Here are the other posts:<br />

<p>The New Testament does not contain many clearly worded &ldquo;thou shalt not&rdquo; commands like you find in Exodus 20. But one of the few cases where one of these commands exists is almost universally ignored. 1 Corinthians 3:21 says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Therefore let no man glory in men&hellip;&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
That&rsquo;s not ambiguous. That&rsquo;s not hard to understand.<br />

<p>Lest you think I&rsquo;m pulling these words out of context, almost all of the first three chapters of 1 Corinthians are dealing with preacher worship. Go back and read them. This is the conclusion of those chapters.</p>
<p>Yet a sin that there are three whole chapters about in the New Testament is almost never mentioned in modern Independent Baptist pulpits. Why? Because preacher worship is a sin that is treated <strong>as a virtue</strong> in a large number of Independent Baptist pulpits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use Jack Hyles because he is an easy example. (Please note, I&rsquo;m not attacking Jack Hyles, I&rsquo;m making an observation about his followers.) I&rsquo;ve heard of preachers praying to Jack Hyles. I&rsquo;ve know pastors who will only use books coming from Hyles Anderson&rsquo;s bookstore. I&rsquo;ve heard preachers joke about Jack Hyles being the fourth member of the trinity. I&rsquo;ve heard more than one person walk through the Crown College campus (a museum to Christians of the past) and lament that the display for Jack Hyles wasn&rsquo;t bigger. &nbsp;Then there is ads like this....</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s not the only example.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 3 teaches that</p>
<ul>
<li>preachers are <strong>servants</strong>, not superstars.<br />
<em>Who is Paul, who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed&hellip;</em> (3:5a)</li></p>
<li>preachers are <strong>expendable</strong><br />
<em>even as the Lord gave to every man?</em>(3:5b)</li></p>
<li>preachers are<strong> not competitors</strong> <em>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one</em> (3:8a) <em>For we are labourers together with God:</em> (3:9a)</li>
<li>preachers are <strong>accountable</strong> to God for our work<br />
<em>Every man&rsquo;s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire;"</em> (3:13)</li><br />
</ul><br />
Now, I&rsquo;m just one guy, who pastors a small church in the cornfields of Central Illinois, but it seems to me that most Independent Baptists are not as dogmatic in their application of 1 Corinthians 3:21 as they are Deuteronomy 22:5.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s emphasize what God emphasizes.</p>
