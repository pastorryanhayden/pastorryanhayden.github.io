<p><em>My good friend <a href="http://www.ministryconnectionpodcast.com/">Bryan Ries</a> asked me to do a screencast explaining the basics of podcasts. &nbsp;It's taken me awhile, but here it is. &nbsp;I tried to do this in such a way that if someone in your church who is not tech savvy asked "what's that podcast thingy??" you could have a basic resource to point them to. &nbsp;Below the video is a transcript.</em></p>
<p>At Bible Baptist, I sometimes mention our daily podcast. I'm sure people are thinking "Podcast" what's a podcast? Even if they know what it is, they may not know how to sign up for one, so I'm going to take a few minutes and explain that.</p>
<h2>What is a podcast?</h2><br />
Short answer: A podcast is a series of audio or video programs that are automatically downloaded to your computer or mobile device.</p>
<p>Whoa... Let's break that down.</p>
<p><strong>First, it's a series.</strong> Like a radio or video show. It's an ongoing thing. You can find podcasts about almost any subject - I mean, there are podcasts about knitting and there are podcasts about web design and there are podcasts about filmmaking and economics and almost anything else you can think of.</p>
<p><strong>Second, its audio or video programs.</strong> For each of these series, there someone who is regularly making audio files or video files for your enjoyment. They could making them in a fancy professional studio with thousands of dollars worth the equipment, but most likely they are making these files on an inexpensive microphone or with an inexpensive camera and editing it on their laptop. That's why there is such a wide variety of podcasts available. Because you don't have to be a professional to make one, anybody can produce one.</p>
<p><strong>Third, they are automatically downloaded to your computer or mobile phone.</strong> The thing that makes podcasts really neat is you don't have to go looking for them every time one comes out. You subscribe to a podcast through podcasting software which is often built into your smart phone or computer. Every time a new episode comes out, it is automatically downloaded to your computer or smartphone so you can listen to it.</p>
<p>About eight years ago, I really wanted to learn web design. The problem was, I knew next to nothing about it. I didn't know anybody who did it. Nothing. I could go to Barnes and Noble and buy an expensive book, but I had no idea which ones were worth buying or even what many of them were about. I found a podcast called Boagworld. It was put out by a couple of web developers in England. It was well done and entertaining, but more importantly, it helped me greatly in understanding web design. I used similar podcasts to learn photoshop and indesign.</p>
<p>I also subscribe to several news podcasts and sermon podcasts. My favorite podcasts, though, are ones where pastors discuss ministry philosophy and practice. There are several of them out there I subscribe to.</p>
<p>I am now a podcaster. I have a daily, one minute devotional podcast that I produce every day. It's called <em>"A Minute With Jesus."</em> and I'll give a link to it later.</p>
<p>So a podcast is a series of audio or video programs that are automatically downloaded to your computer or mobile device.</p>
<h2>Next Question: How Do You Subscribe to a Podcast?</h2><br />
I'm going to show you how to sign up for a podcast using software you probably have on your computer - iTunes. iTunes is not the only program you can use on your computer for podcasts, but it's probably the most popular one.</p>
<p>It's really simple. Just...</p>
<ul>
<li>open the iTunes program on your computer.</li>
<li>Then click on the link at the top right that says "iTunes store."</li>
<li>Across the top, there are links that say Music, Movies, TV Shows, App Store, etc. One of the links says Podcasts. Click on that link.</li>
<li>Here you will find a directory of podcasts you can sign up for. There are literally thousands of them.</li>
<li>On the right, there is a link for categories, if you click on it, you can use this to narrow your search.</li>
<li>But there are so many podcasts, the ones I recommend are really hard to find just browsing. So I suggest you use the search function at the top right.</li>
<li>To find our podcast, you can search for "A Minute With Jesus"</li>
<li>You can see our Minute With Jesus podcast right at the top. If you click on the button under Podcast, you'll see a subscribe button under the "minute with Jesus" logo. Click it and you are subscribed.</li>
<li>It's that easy.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Another way to subscribe to a podcast is through podcast's web site. One of my favorite podcasts is "The Ministry Connection Podcast" A podcast for independent Baptist pastors. It's web site is "TheMinistryConnectionPodcast.com"</p>
<ul>
<li>At the bottom of website, there is a "subscribe on iTunes" button. If you click it, it will open up iTunes to the store with the subscribe link right there for you to click. Again, if you click subscribe, you'll be subscribed and have your podcasts automatically on your computer whenever a new one comes out.</li><br />
</ul><br />
You can use a similar process on a mobile phone. It's different on Android, iPhone and Windows Phone, but it's pretty self explanatory.</p>
<p>Let's look at one more question...</p>
<h2>How do you listen to it?</h2><br />
This is easy. Just open iTunes. Up on the top left there is a button that says "Music" if you click on it, it will open a list, and you can click "podcasts." Right there you'll se the list. Just click on the podcast and you'll see the most recent episodes ready to be listened to.</p>
<p>I hope you've found this helpful. How 'bout helping me out by subscribing to the "Minute With Jesus" podcast right now.</p>
