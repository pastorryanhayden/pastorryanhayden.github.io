<p>Last week, an <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/johnshore/2013/11/an-open-letter-to-students-of-independent-fundamental-baptist-ifb-colleges/">Open Letter to Students of IFB colleges</a> popped up on the internet. It was a letter that I found offensive on many levels, so I want to reply in kind with an open letter to the author of said letter:&nbsp;<a href="http://johnshore.com/about/">John Shore</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Greetings, my name is Ryan Hayden, I'm the pastor of an Independent Baptist Church (IFB) and I too believe in the literal divinity, miracles, atonement and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I'll add to that that I believe in the inerrancy and verbal preservation of scripture (an important epistemology defining belief that you left out of your open letter.)</p>
<p>Over the years, I too have come to know many Independent Baptists. As a former student of two different IFB colleges, as an IFB pastor who may at times recommend those colleges, and as a blogger who primarily writes about excesses within the IFB movement, I want to answer the claims of your open letter:</p>
<p>You start your letter by saying that IFB stands for "Irresponsible Fundamentalist Bullies" and state that the most bullied people in IFB circles are the students of IFB colleges. I'll admit that there is <em>some</em> bullying that goes on at <em>some</em> IFB colleges. (Just as there is <em>some</em> bullying that goes on in <em>some</em> liberal university classrooms - I don't think I would feel very welcome in Bill Ayer's classroom.) I don't want to, in any way, belittle those who were hurt by bullying, where it occurred but I would not say that all of the students at IFB colleges are bullied and I would not say as you said that no one is more bullied in the IFB than IFB college students.</p>
<p><strong>So I take issue with the central premise of your letter Mr. Shore.</strong> But even if I did agree with your premise, I'd have the following to say:</p>
<h2>1. Stop Bullying</h2><br />
The main point of your open letter is that IFB college students are bullied, and yet you act the bully in the open letter. It never ceases to amaze me how often those who preach tolerance the loudest are intolerant of those who hold to traditional truth claims. (<a href="http://foxnewsinsider.com/2012/04/30/dan-savage-bullies-christian-teens-in-speech-at-anti-bullying-conference-says-to-ignore-bull-in-the-bible">Remember a speech by a certain Dan Savage</a>.). It would seem to me that name calling, veiled threats, belittling implications and straw men would not be at home in a letter designed to show the IFB as a bunch of bullies - but then again, I only went to IFB pseudo-colleges so I obviously have no idea what I'm talking about.</p>
<h2>2. Admit your bias</h2><br />
The first few paragraphs of your letter are obviously intended to present you as someone sympathetic to biblical Christianity. Yet a simple google search shows that you are an pro-homosexual activist who is recommended by such stalwart theological conservatives as Rob Bell and John Spong. You are an ordained minister of the Progressive Christian Alliance, and you are the founder of a group called Unfundamentalist Christians. In other words, you have such a strong bias against fundamentalists, that you've committed much of your life to destroying them. This bias would obviously color your open letter.</p>
<p>You failed to mention this in your letter (but it came out anyway.)</p>
<h2>3. Stop broad brushing</h2><br />
Your letter says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The IFB holds that women are inherently inferior to men, that they are intended by God to be nothing but mothers and "helpmeets" to their husbands. IFB believes that godly parents methodically beat their young children in order to "break their will." IFB fights to deny its children an education (to the extent that it runs such sham "colleges" as the one you now attend.) IFB sends its "disobedient" teens to unsupervised "homes," where they are horrifically abused and degraded...</blockquote><br />
Really??</p>
<p>How have I spent 29 years somehow attached to the IFB movement and never met one person who believes all of that? (I can honestly say I've met very few people who would believe any one of those things, even in isolation.) Also, How did I miss that there is any IFB that agrees on anything? Where is the official IFB statement of faith? At what convention did we agree the above platform?</p>
<p>Let me ask you: Is there anybody who you went to school with that committed a heinous crime? How would you like it if I used the worst examples of your school to tarnish your name?</p>
<p>Not only do you have a progressive bias, but you obviously paint with a very broad brush and have only black and white at your disposal. Your letter left exactly zero room for gradation while attempting to describe a massive group of thousands of unaffiliated churches. I didn't think stereotyping minority groups was ok with progressives. Are justice and truth reserved only for articles about homosexuals and liberal politics?</p>
<h2>4. Consider your sources</h2><br />
You say...</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past few years I have come to know a lot of members of the Independent Fundamental Baptists.</blockquote><br />
Well, I'd say you probably should have met some more before you wrote your article, because the group you attacked looks nothing like my church, nothing like the churches of anyone in my local preacher's fellowship, and nothing like the IFB colleges I attended.</p>
<p>Be honest. You are a progressive activist. What percentage of those "a lot of members" are disgruntled former members with a bias of their own? How many are the type of obsessed ex-IFB who frequently read and agree with the comments at Stuff Fundies Like or any of the Patheos blogs? Is it at all possible that not only you have a bias, but the vast majority of your sources do as well?</p>
<h2>In conclusion.</h2><br />
Your open letter did remind me of one truth. Prospective Bible college students probably need some advice that they are not getting. So as a pastor and former IFB college student, this is the advice I would give to a teenager who was thinking about attending an IFB college.</p>
<h3>1. If you are going for ministry realize it's not for everyone.</h3><br />
If you go to school at a Bible College, you need to realize up front that that degree isn't going to get you very far in the secular workforce. You also need to realize that a very large proportion of students who study ministry, never end up in the pastorate or some other form of full-time ministry. Even among those who do, the vast majority labor in obscurity making very little money.</p>
<p>In other words, if you want to go to school for the ministry, make very sure that you are called to do it and are not doing it out of some mistaken form of peer pressure because it is a major life decision that could alter your future significantly.</p>
<h3>2. No mater where you go, you are going to go to school with with a small percentage of complete idiots.</h3><br />
A good portion of the students at your IFB school are not there because they want to be there, many are there because they are trying to please their parents. There will also be many unhealthy cliques in your college - including some who may seem zealous about the ministry but who could shipwreck your life and skew your view of the ministry. Despite both of these things, you will probably meet a bunch of great and like-minded people who will remain lifelong friends. &nbsp;(By the way, often the idiots grow out of it.)</p>
<h3>3. You will be under strict institutional rules - never get the idea they come from scripture or think they'll apply to you for the rest of your life.</h3><br />
In no small part because of the groups above, your Bible college handbook will be ridiculous. Just remember that wonderful verse (that isn't really in the Bible.) "This too shall pass." Very few people think their Bible College handbook is normative for the rest of their life. , don't ever be one of them. You'll get through it and may even grow to appreciate the experience someday.</p>
<h3>4. You're allegiance is not to your school, but to Christ, His Word and His Church.</h3><br />
You may be tempted (or even pressured) to have excessive loyalty to your school. Remember that your loyalty is first and foremost to Christ. If your school is worthy, they won't be asking for you to give them more loyalty than your local church, and won't expect you to be partisan to them in the future.</p>
<p><strong>In closing let me give you one last thing:</strong></p>
<h2>5. I had a wonderful time in Christian college - keep it in perspective and you will too.</h2></p>
