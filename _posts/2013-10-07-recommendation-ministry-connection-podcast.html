<p>I don't often recommend things on this blog. I like to keep it about ministry and ministry philosophy, and I imagine that most of the people who read this are pastors or other ministry leaders. You don't want to know what I had for dinner. You've got enough problems of your own.</p>
<p>I'm going to break that pattern today by recommending a new project I'm really excited about. Pastor Bryan Ries has started <em>The Ministry Connection Podcast</em>, a weekly conversation style podcast for independent Baptist ministry leaders. I've really enjoyed listening to it so far. I've even invited brother Ries to our church to preach.</p>
<p><strong>It's not a typical ministry podcast.</strong> It's not a sermon or one person teaching. Brother Ries does a good job of making it feel like a two-way conversation. He stitches together a lot of listener input (I've even been on there), and keeps the podcast both upbeat and entertaining.</p>
<p>If you're a pastor, I really suggest you go to iTunes and subscribe to the podcast today.</p>
