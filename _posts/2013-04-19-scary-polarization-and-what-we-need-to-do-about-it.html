<p>Wednesday, I wrote a <a title="JG-TC Letter to the Editor" href="http://jg-tc.com/news/opinion/mailbag/letter-physician-trial-should-be-big-news/article_8935b348-a6d3-11e2-8064-0019bb2963f4.html" target="_blank">letter to the editor</a> about the lack of coverage of the Kermit Gosnell trial. I didn't use any heated language. I didn't call anybody names. I merely stated that it was one of the most horrific things I'd ever seen, that it was gut wrenching to me as a parent, and that it was worth looking into if you haven't heard of it. At the moment, it has 32 comments on the newspaper website.</p>
<p>What amazes me every time I write in the newspaper is the massive ideological divide that surfaces around any moral issue. In the comments, one guy almost immediately started railing against republican hypocrisy, alleging that Rick Santorum's wife had an affair with an abortion doctor, and posting anti-Christian quotes from racy movies (even though I didn't mention Republicans, Rick Santorum, or Christianity in my letter). One woman accused me of wanting abortion to be illegal so that I could "have more sinners to threaten with hell" and "kick with my morals cherry picked out of a book of fairly tales." The positive comments predictably talked about the sanctity of life and the horrors of abortion. You could not get a sharper divide.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is the future our country faces. The ideological polarization of our country is there, it's growing, and it's only going to get worse. For Christians committed to the Bible, our future (at least by human standards) seems pretty bleak. It reminds me of these verses from 2 Timothy:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</em>" <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Timothy3%3A12-13" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Timothy 3:12-13</a></blockquote><br />
So what should we do? The verses continue:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;"</em></blockquote><br />
And what are we to continue in?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."</em></blockquote><br />
These verses are, of course, directly before my favorite verses, <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/2Timothy3%3A16-17" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Christianity-light isn't winning any hearts and minds.</strong> As we face polarization and eventually persecution as Christians, we desperately need to recommit ourselves to biblical Christianity. Not only is it the only thing that will bring us through the dark days ahead, but true biblical Christianity will baffle our critics, and God might use our witness to make some of them <em>"wise unto salvation."</em></p>
