<p><i>Every Sunday Morning, I post my sermon manuscript here. &nbsp;I know most people don&rsquo;t have time to read a full manuscript, and I also know that these manuscripts will defnitely have even more spelling and grammar errors in them than my normal blog posts, but I&rsquo;m going to post them here anyway in the hope that they can help someone. &nbsp;This is the first message in a series titled: <b>The Gifts of Christmas</b>. &nbsp;We will resume Ephesians in January.</i></p>

<p>I want you to take your Bibles with me and turn to John 1. John 1.</p>
<p>Every year around Christmas time, I take a break from our normal study and do a Christmas series. A couple of years ago, we looked at some of the Christmas stories in the New Testament. Last year we looked at some of the Old Testament prophecies about Christ from Handel&rsquo;s Messiah.</p>
<p>This year, I want to get started a little early (although, it&rsquo;s not as early as you would think) and look at The Gifts of that first Christmas.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things that annoys me is that stores seem to be pushing Christmas earlier and earlier. I think some of the stores had Christmas trees up in September. September! This is why I usually wait until the last minute to start singing Christmas songs in Church - because the world seems to be commercializing Christmas and pushing it earlier and earlier.</p>
<p>But we are going to start this Christmas series early, and we are going to spend about six weeks on it.</p>
<p>The other night in Patch Clubs, as we were working on a Christmas song, I asked a group of about 15 kids what their favorite part about Christmas was - without missing a beat they all said &ldquo;the gifts.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves, when kids think about Christmas, it is the gifts that they think about first. Let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves, when adults think about Christmas, many of them think about gifts first.</p>
<p>What I want to do is to look again at the Christmas story - the story of Jesus Christ coming to this earth in human flesh - and to consider each of the characters we know and love in the story. Joseph and Mary, Zachariah and Elizabeth, The Wise Men, The Shepherds. All of them. We&rsquo;ll consider each one, one Sunday at a time, and we will talk about the unique gifts that they have left for us.</p>
<p>We are going to start at the top though. We are going to start with God.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s all turn to John 1. John 1.</p>
<p>When we think of the Christmas story - we often think about the manger in Bethlehem. Maybe we think about Mary or Joseph&rsquo;s house in Nazareth. Maybe we think about shepherds in the field or about Herod in the temple. But that isn&rsquo;t where this story starts. This story starts in heaven. It starts in God&rsquo;s throne room. It starts long before the foundation of the world in the mind of God the Father. All of it was according to God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get started by reading one of the gospel accounts of the birth of Christ.</p>
<p>Each of the gospels tells the story from a different vantage point and highlights different people, but the book of John starts from the vantage point of heaven and highlights God&rsquo;s role in Jesus coming to earth.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s read John 1:1-14</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;<a>Jhn 1:1-14 KJV</a> 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. 4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name <a>was</a> John. 7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all <a>men</a> through him might believe. 8 He was not that Light, but <a>was sent</a> to bear witness of that Light. 9 <a>That</a> was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. 11 He came unto his own, and his own rece ived him not. 12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, <a>even</a> to them that believe on his name: 13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
I want to talk about the gifts of God at Christmas this morning. Of course we know that God&rsquo;s great Christmas gift was Jesus Christ. All of us have heard John 3:16 - <em>&ldquo;For God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>You could have that first Christmas without a manger, you could have it without wise men, you could have it in a totally different place and with totally different characters - but you couldn&rsquo;t have it without Jesus. What made that day so special, so special that we literally count our days by it, was the coming of Christ.</p>
<p>John 1 tells us many things about why God sent Christ, but there are three aspects of it I want to highlight for you this morning, Three gifts God gave us on that very first Christmas.</p>
<p><strong><em>Before I give them to you, let&rsquo;s pray.</em></strong></p>
<p>The first gift I see in this passage is actually found in verse 14. The last verse we read. It says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
The first gift God the Father gave us on that first Christmas was&hellip;</p>
<h2 class="">1. The gift of an illustration.</h2><br />
Why did Jesus come? Why did He come as a man? Why did He live a fairly ordinary life, rubbing up against ordinary people, doing ordinary work?</p>
<p>The reason is so that the Word could be made flesh.</p>
<p>You see, all through the Old Testament, we have the Word of God. That&rsquo;s how God revealed Himself to people. Through mount Sinai, through the tabernacle, through the prophets. Just little pieces here and there to show people who God was.</p>
<p>Even if you were to look at the most sacred place in the jewish religion - the tabernacle, and you were to go into the Holy Place, and then into the Holy of Holies, where only the High Priest could go and only once a year. If you were to look in there at the ark of the covenant, and look on top of the mercy seat where the presence of God dwelt - what would you see?</p>
<p>Nothing. No idol. No carving. Nothing. Two cheribim looking at nothing. A blank space.</p>
<p>There was something about God in the Old Testament that was purposely mysterious. He was always high, holy and lifted up. He was always coming as a cloud, or as a burning bush, or as a still small voice. Always something nebulous. Always something mysterious.</p>
<p>And yet, on that first Christmas, when Christ made his first cry, the Word was made flesh and we were given the greatest illustration of the character of God that there has ever been and ever will be.</p>
<p>Think of it like this - when I was a teenager, for awhile, the in thing was these WWJD bracelets. Even NBA and NFL guys were wearing them. What would Jesus do? Imagine asking that question in the Old Testament time? You wouldn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;what would Jesus do?&rdquo; You&rsquo;d say &ldquo;what would God do?&rdquo; and you would have a hard time answering that question. You&rsquo;d know God&rsquo;s law. You might know about some of God&rsquo;s acts. But it would be hard to think of God as a person, doing personal things.</p>
<p>But when Jesus came, the Word became flesh. We got to see God walking around. We got to see the character and the heart of God in a personal way.</p>
<ul>
<li>We saw God looking after His mother.</li>
<li>We saw God feeding the hungry.</li>
<li>We saw God healing so, so many people.</li>
<li>We saw the heart of God as He said things like <em>&ldquo;Oh, Jerusalem, Oh, Jerusalem, how often would I have&hellip;&rdquo;</em></li>
<li>We got to see God spurning the Pharisees and all other forms of heartless religion.</li>
<li>We got to see Him throwing over the money changers in the Temple.</li><br />
</ul><br />
But most notably, we got to see God spending time with Publicans and Sinners. We got to see him taking time for people like Levi and Zacheus. We got to see Jesus saying to the woman taken in adultery - <em>&ldquo;neither do I condemn thee - go and sin no more.&rdquo;</em> We got to see Him as he was being beaten mercilessly by a Roman guard say <em>&ldquo;Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.&rdquo;</em> We got to see the heart of Jesus for sinners.</p>
<p>And there could be no greater illustration of Jesus heart for sinners than the ultimate place Jesus came to go to. The place that was always in the shadow of the manger, in the shadow of the miracles - the reason for Christ&rsquo;s coming - the cross.</p>
<p>If you want to see the word become flesh. If you want to see the heart of God for mankind, you need look no further than the cross.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the second gift God gave us that first Christmas - not only did He give us an illustration - He gave us&hellip;</p>
<h2 class="">2. The gift of salvation.</h2><br />
Look at verses 10-13</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;<a>Jhn 1:10-12 KJV</a> 10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. 11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not. 12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, <a>even</a> to them that believe on his name: 13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
Here we see the second gift God gave us when He sent us Jesus on that first Christmas - He gave us the power to be born of God. To become the sons of God. To have the life, the light, living inside of us.</p>
<p>As awesome as the Christmas story is. As awesome as Mary and Joseph, and the wise men, and the manger, and all of that is - we must always remember it&rsquo;s just chapter one in a book, it just sets the setting. Jesus didn&rsquo;t come to be the perennial lawn ornament - the baby in the manger we see on everyone&rsquo;s yard - Jesus came to die.</p>
<p>As we sang earlier - He was born to die on Calvary. He was born to be our savior.</p>
<p>Now - there is actually a very good doctrinal reason for the Christmas story. Jesus was born of a virgin - that&rsquo;s kind of the central part of the Christmas story. That is what we are celebrating. But why? Why did Jesus have to be born of a virgin? Why couldn&rsquo;t He be born like you and I were?</p>
<p>The reason is because Jesus came to be our savior and our substitute. In order for Him to be our substitute - He had to be fully human - so He had to have a mother and be born. In order to be our savior - He had to be divine and born without a sin nature. It would do Him no good to pay for our penalty if He had his own to pay for, and even if He didn&rsquo;t have His own to pay for, if He was a mere man He could pay the penalty for only one other man.</p>
<p>So this was always heading somewhere - every part of it was a precursor to Calvary.</p>
<p>Let me again read to you the most famous verse in the Bible - John 3:16</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
God gave us Jesus to be killed as our sacrifice at Calvary, and whoever believes on Christ can be saved.</p>
<p>I like how John 3:36 puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
Have you believed on Jesus? Was there a time in your life when you put your faith and trust in Jesus, repented of your sins, and believed what He has done on your behalf?</p>
<p>I hope so. But if you haven&rsquo;t, you could do that today. Today could be better for you than any Christmas. Today could be the day you get eternal life.</p>
<p>One more gift we can see that God gave us in Jesus Christ:</p>
<h2 class="">3. The gift of adoption.</h2><br />
Verses 12-13 say</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, <a>even</a> to them that believe on his name: 13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
Not only did God give us an illustration in Jesus - the Word was made flesh. Not only did He give us a savior in Jesus, but He made a way in Jesus for us to become a part of God&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Now, this is all of grace church. We didn&rsquo;t deserve salvation. We didn&rsquo;t. We didn&rsquo;t deserve for God to show us His character through Jesus. If God gave us Jesus just as our illustration and as a way for us to not have to face the penalty for our sins - that would be amazingly gracious.</p>
<p>But God also tells us here that we can become a part of His family. We can become <em>&ldquo;the sons of God&rdquo;</em> who have been <em>&ldquo;born of God.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Amanda and I, you know, we don&rsquo;t have any family here. My Mom lives 1100 miles away in New Hampshire, my Dad lives 2200 miles away in the Virgin Islands. My closest relative lives in Cincinnati, OH. Amanda&rsquo;s family is all in Georgia. We are a long way away from our family. Can I tell you, one of the most humbling things that has happened to us since we&rsquo;ve been here is to have some of you welcome us as a sort of extended part of your families. We don&rsquo;t deserve that. It&rsquo;s an awesome privilege.</p>
<p>One of my favorite movies is &ldquo;The Blind Side.&rdquo; Have you ever seen it? It&rsquo;s about a boy from the ghetto in Memphis who gets taken in by a wealthy family there and goes on to play pro football. What a privilege.</p>
<p>But do you know what is an even greater privilege - to be welcomed into God&rsquo;s family. To be able to claim God as our heavenly father.</p>
<p>You know, the Old Testament didn&rsquo;t talk about God as &ldquo;the Father&rdquo; very often. At the most - there are about 15 references to God the father in the Old Testament. There are over 100 just in the book of John! and many more than that in the rest of the New Testament.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been give the power to be called the sons of God. We&rsquo;ve been given adoption.</p>
<h3 class="">Conclusion</h3><br />
In closing this morning, as you start to see manger scenes go up this holiday season and you start to hear the Christmas songs - remember what Christmas is all about. It&rsquo;s all about the coming of Christ.</p>
<p>God gave you an amazing gift in Jesus Christ. But there is something left to do. You&rsquo;ve got to receive the gift. You&rsquo;ve got to believe on Jesus.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never done that? Why not today?</p>
