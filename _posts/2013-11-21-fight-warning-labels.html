<p>This is the last post in my series entitled <strong>"Why We Fight: A Defense of Pushing for IFB Reform."</strong></p>
<p>As a young pastor, I haven't heard too much pushback against <strong>WHAT</strong> young pastors (and some old pastors) are pushing for, but I've heard a lot of criticism of young pastors for saying anything negative about "the IFB" in the first place. It's as if these critics think either 1) Independent Baptist churches are perfect or 2) you have to be a 90 year old mega church pastor to make a valid point.</p>
<p>I've also heard any push for reform labeled as "a bunch of kids trying to tell old men what to do." Personally, I pastor four former IFB pastors, all of them are older than me. Just yesterday I had the awesome privilege of standing on the platform with the man who was my pastor in High School and preaching, (We still have a great relationship.) and I am on the phone all the time getting advice from my mentor, a guy who has been pastoring an IFB church for over forty years. So painting what I'm talking about as a generational struggle is getting it wrong.</p>
<p>A lot of people seem to be getting this struggle wrong. So I've been taking some time this week while I'm on vacation to post the reasons <em>why we fight</em>. The reasons why me and and people like me are pushing for reform in fundamentalism. These aren't necessarily the issues we are fighting for, but our justification for fighting in the first place.</p>
<p>Before I move on to my last reason, I want to summarize all of the reasons I've given so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a title="Why We Fight: More, Not Less." href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/fight-less/">"More, Not Less</a>" I was trying to say: We are trying to rediscover biblical standards for ministry, not remove biblical standards.</li>
<li>In <a title="Why We Fight: The Homeowner&rsquo;s Association Theory" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/fight-homeowners-association-theory/">"The Homeowners Association Theory"</a> I was trying to say: We are acting as self-interested "owners" of independent Baptist churches who are effected by the movement as a whole.</li>
<li>In <a title="Why We Fight: Bambi and Jaws" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/fight-bambi-jaws/">"Bambi and Jaws"</a> I was trying to say: We think it's hypocritical and stupid to only warn people about the dangers outside of IFB churches when people are far more likely to be hurt by the dangers within.</li><br />
</ul><br />
That leads me to my last reason. I call it <strong>The Warning Label</strong>. In <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Romans16%3A17" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Romans 16:17</a> it says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them."</em></blockquote><br />
The word "offenses" in that verse is translated from the Greek word <em>skandalon</em>, it's a word that means (and is sometimes translated) "stumbling block". So this verse is a command from Paul to mark and avoid those who are a stumbling block to the faith of others. Find those whose unbiblical doctrine or unbiblical practice cause division or messes up people's faith, mark them, and avoid them.</p>
<p>So here's my question: Why <strong>*mark</strong>* them? Avoiding them is obvious, why <strong>*mark</strong>*?</p>
<p>I think the reason we are commanded to mark them is because <em><strong>God wants a warning label placed on some people, doctrine and practices.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>When you label something, you significantly reduce the danger of it.</strong> People have enough sense to stay away from rat poison in a jar with a skull and crossbones on it. Those same people could possibly gobble up a cheeseburger with the same rat poison in it. When we know something is poisonous - we stay away. That same poison - subtly placed in something we assume to be safe - could be slowly killing us. Labels save lives.</p>
<p><strong>I believe that there are beliefs and ministry practices prevalent in the IFB movement that really hurt people.</strong> I've seen the effects of a pastor who won't preach the Bible (and who subtly turns himself into the authority.) I've seen people destroyed by a man who made himself a god to his congregation, then fell into adultery (many times over). I've heard men justify awful, unchristian, unbiblical behavior with "Dr. so and so did it." I've seen people completely leave fundamentalism when they realize the premise they've accepted their entire life, that they are sole islands of truth in a sea of apostasy, is a sham.</p>
<p>Now, I don't believe that these things go on in <strong>every</strong> IFB church. I don't even think they go on in <strong>most</strong> IFB churches. <strong>But they do go on</strong>. Then, time and again we see the awful consequences of these unbiblical ministry practices and then scratch our head about how they could possibly happen.</p>
<p>So I'm of the opinion it's time to start marking. It's time to pull out the roll of warning labels.</p>
<p>Let's label unbiblical preaching. Let's label preacher-worship. Let's label factionalism. These aren't victimless crimes. They are stumbling blocks that are ruining people's faith.</p>
<p>We cannot make them cease to exist but we can put a warning label on them so people don't stop slowly killing themselves by swallowing them in what they consider safe - their local independent Baptist church.</p>
