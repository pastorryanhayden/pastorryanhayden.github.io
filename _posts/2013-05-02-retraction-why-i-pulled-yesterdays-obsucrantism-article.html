<p>Yesterday I posted an article about "Why Obscurantism Does't Work Anymore" where I wrote about the dangers of an obscurantist attitude toward questions and information. But a commentator (who I do not know) pointed out that there are times when a pastor needs to discourage his people from getting into certain kinds of information and he gave biblical examples.</p>
<p>While I still think that obscurantism is a problem, and in many cases I think there is a "just accept what I say and don't ask questions" attitude among pastors (which is surely not biblical) I don't want to give the impression that I think it's a bad thing for pastors to warn about the dangers of immersing yourself in doctrinal error.</p>
<p>So I pulled the article. Maybe, someday in the future, I will revise it and repost it when I feel like it's a little more ironed out and balanced.</p>
