<p>On the wall in my study <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Isaiah2" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">is 2</a> Timothy 2:24</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient."</em></blockquote><br />
It went on the wall several years ago, before I was a senior pastor, when I was being criticized by a few people in the ministry and was really struggling with it. I do not handle criticism well. My first reaction is usually to go after the person who criticizes me, and the Lord used that verse to help me realize that as a ministry leader, I had a responsibility to live above the fray. Many times since then, I have looked up at that verse and been convicted about my own attitude.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/James3" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">James 3</a> is all about preachers and teachers. It starts with the admonition "be not many masters (teachers)" and then it goes on to tell us how we can tell a good and a bad teacher. Verses 13-18 conclude this topic by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. 14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. 16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. 17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace."</em></blockquote><br />
According to James, if a man is characterized by strife <strong>he absolutely does not possess spiritual wisdom</strong>. If a man does have spiritual wisdom he will be <em>pure, peaceable, gentle and easy to be intreated</em>, etc. Then it goes on to say <em>"the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace."</em></p>
<p>As a fundamentalist, I believe we are to <em>"earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints,"</em> but that is a very different thing than earnestly defending my little tribe, or earnestly defending myself against every whim of criticism (both of which I'm prone to do.) Even as I defend the faith, however, I cannot allow myself to become contentious. I have no right to allow theological or philosophical battles to make me unkind, unpeacable, or hard to be intreated. When my desire becomes the destruction of my ideological opponents, rather than the peaceful conversion of them to a point of view, I'm in the wrong.</p>
<p>In standing for the truth, there is the danger for us to be overtaken by bloodlust, to forget civility, and to become partisan attackers of anybody who disagrees with us. To use the words of Spurgeon:</p>
<blockquote><p>Certainly we are not to show our decision by that obstinate, furious, wolfish bigotry which cuts off every other body from the chance and hope of salvation and the possibility of being regenerate or even decently honest if they happen to differ from us about the color of a scale of the great leviathan.</blockquote><br />
Truth is important, but it must be tempered by love and grace.</p>
