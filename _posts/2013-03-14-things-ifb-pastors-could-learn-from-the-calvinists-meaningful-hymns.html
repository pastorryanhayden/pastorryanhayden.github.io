<p>This week I&rsquo;m writing about &ldquo;Things IFB pastors could learn from the Calvinists.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not a calvinist. Been there, done that, bought the t-shirt. While I don&rsquo;t think hard core calvinism is Biblical or healthy, I think that calvinists have a lot to teach us.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a lot of the young guys who are going &ldquo;calvi&rdquo; probably wouldn&rsquo;t if we&rsquo;d learn these things.</p>

<h1 id="hymnsthatmeansomething.">3. Hymns that mean something.</h1><br />
When I was going off to Bible college, my Pastor gave me a pretty neat gift, a hymn book that was written and published in the early 1800s. I determined not to just make it a keepsake, but to read it. When I read it, I was astounded at the biblical and doctrinal content of the hymns.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/shallow.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-947" alt="shallow" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/03/shallow-1024x583.jpg" width="628" height="357" /></a></p>
<p>At that time, when I thought of &ldquo;the good old hymns&rdquo; I thought of songs like <em>&ldquo;Victory in Jesus&rdquo;</em> or John W. Peterson songs, or the songs made popular by Fanny Crosby or D.L. Moody&rsquo;s lieutenants. While none of these songs are outright bad, they pale in comparison to the songs written in the centuries before. Songs like <em>&ldquo;Be Still My Soul&rdquo;</em>, or <em>&ldquo;And Can It Be.&rdquo;</em> Songs that are rich in doctrinal content.</p>
<h3 id="newwaveofhymnwriting">New wave of hymn writing</h3><br />
Today we have hymn writers, mostly calvinists, writing meaningful hymns like <em>&ldquo;How Deep the Fathers Love to Us&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;In Christ Alone&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;My Jesus Fair&rdquo;</em> and retuning older songs like <em>&ldquo;Before the Throne of God Above.&rdquo;</em> Mainly because of the calvinists, we are seeing a resurgence in truly old fashioned hymns.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that a resurgence in calvinism has resulted in a resurgence of doctrinal hymns is because calvinists emphasize doctrine instead of running from it. Another is they have a tendency to be more in touch with their heritage. Whatever the reasons, hymns are improving for it.</p>
<h3 id="oldfashionedsongsthatarent">Old fashioned songs that aren&rsquo;t</h3><br />
<strong>There is a bubble gum and candy flavor to many of the hymns sung in Independent Baptist churches.</strong> We criticize the Praise and Worship community for their 7&ndash;11 songs, (singing seven words eleven times) but many of the songs we consider &ldquo;great old hymns&rdquo; are 1) not very old and 2) about as deep as the divot on a golf ball. (Let&rsquo;s be honest, &ldquo;Love Lifted Me&rdquo; is not exactly "strong meat.")</p>
<p>When our young people compare our hymnody with those of the resurgent calvinists, which do you think they are going to find more meaningful?</p>
<p>We need to go back to singing songs that are rich in doctrinal content. There are some parts of the calvinist resurgence I can&rsquo;t stomach (mainly the calvinism part) but I think a return to doctrinal hymns is a very, very positive thing. If we don&rsquo;t jump on the bandwagon, then, the way things are going, we are going to end up in the awkward position of having significantly shallower hymns than the CCM crowd.</p>
