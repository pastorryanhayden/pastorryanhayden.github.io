<p>Recently, I ordered a new Mac Mini for my office. Because of the nature of what I do (a lot of design stuff) I bought the top tier Mac Mini, and then upgraded it to 16GB of Ram (mostly because the ram in this computer isn't user-upgradable and I didn't want to have to replace it in two years.)</p>
<p>So here is the configuration I&rsquo;m ending up with:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2014-11-05-09.43.48.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2007" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2014-11-05-09.43.48.png" alt="Screenshot 2014-11-05 09.43.48" width="557" height="120" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m paying $1199 for this computer.</p>
<p>Now, I wanted to address the accusation that Macs are more expensive with an experiment. I went on NewEgg.com to try to figure out the cost of building a machine with similar specs.</p>
<p>Here is what I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>I started with the processor. I was unable to locate Intel&rsquo;s latest (Haswell) processor for individual purchase, so I was stuck with an older model with older far-inferior integrated graphics. It costs $294.</li>
<li>The processor needs a motherboard. One with built in AC wifi, at least two thunderbolt ports, and USB 3. $255</li>
<li>We need ram. $154</li>
<li>A fusion drive is actually a 1GB &ldquo;regular&rdquo; hard drive ($65) and a 128 GB SSD ($90) acting in tandem - $155 total</li>
<li>The Mac Mini has Bluetooth 4.0 - $35</li>
<li>The Mac Mini claims to be the quietest and most power efficient computer ever - so let&rsquo;s get a top of the line efficient fan/power supply - $130</li>
<li>We need a nice tidy box to put this is. Nothing even comes close to the mac mini, but here is one for - $95.</li>
<li>Our computer so far isn&rsquo;t running an operating system, and because this isn&rsquo;t a mac, that doesn&rsquo;t come with it - we&rsquo;ll have to purchase that for an additional $100</li><br />
</ul><br />
If you are doing the math, this frankencomputer will cost me $1,218 dollars to build. That&rsquo;s with an inferior processor, an inferior operating system, an inferior case, and a hobbled together hard drive alternative.</p>
<p>Now, I know that these would not work together. I know, for example, that the processor won&rsquo;t work with that motherboard. I know that I left out a fan. I wasn&rsquo;t really trying to build a computer, I was trying to make a point.</p>
<p>The point is this - the &ldquo;apple tax&rdquo; is illusory. Sure, Macs are never going to be price-competitive in the &ldquo;race for the bottom commoditized hardware market. You&rsquo;ll always be able to find a Dell or HP&nbsp;machine that is cheaper.</p>
<p><em>But not that much cheaper.</em>&nbsp;And probably with cheaper parts.&nbsp;And definitely without the attention to detail and design that comes with every single Mac. <strong>Sometimes, the whole is more than the some of it&rsquo;s parts.</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just hardware. When you add the rock solid operating system (in 10 years, I&rsquo;ve never had antivirus software or a virus) to the mix, actually useful bundled software like Keynote and iMovie, and first class customer support. (Seriously, have you ever had to call HP customer support?) When you consider the fact that you&rsquo;ll have access to an excellent software market that absolutely crushes the windows marketplace and can use mac only apps like <a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com/">Ulysses III</a> for writing, <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> for UX design, <a href="http://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> for FTP, and many, many others.</p>
<p>That Mac stops looking like a luxury item, and starts looking like one of the best deals in tech.</p>
