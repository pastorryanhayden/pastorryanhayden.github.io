<p>This election is already being called the <em>"status quo election."</em> What the pundits obviously mean by that is that little has changed: same liberal president, same liberal senate, same determined republican house majority. It's looking like four more years of bickering. In contrast, &nbsp;I want to use the <em>"status quo"</em> label to bring out an entirely different point.<br />
There is one principle in American politics that both Republicans and Democrats easily forget:</p></p>
<blockquote><p>Politics is a thermometer, not a thermostat. &nbsp;If a person or position wins in a democratic election, it is because a majority of voting americans want him/it to.</blockquote></p>
<p>So what does that principle and last nights election results tell us about the <em>status quo</em> of America? The most liberal president in recent history carried over 50% of the popular vote, despite the fact that he used <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6G3nwhPuR4">seedy ads with immoral undertones</a>, had no platform to speak of, and was put in place by a party that put God back on the ticket as an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUJE9YfsbNQ">unpopular concession</a>. In at least two states, gay marriage was approved by a popular vote and in two other states, the legalization of marijuana was approved by a popular vote. It's not too much of a stretch then, to assume that the majority of americans have rejected Judeo-Christian morality. That is the new <em>"status quo"</em> of our country.<br />
So how do we change it? If you are thinking "let's batten down the hatches, pick even more conservative candidates in 2014 and 2016 and win back the White House" you are missing the point. <em><strong>You cannot change people with politics</strong></em>, and it is the people, not the politicians that gave us last nights results. So if politics is not the answer, what is? Let me give you my <strong>"Three Step Plan to Winning Back America."</strong> Ready?<br />
<strong>First, make sure your Christianity is real.</strong> America will not be won back to it's previous moral state by half-hearted, Sunday-morning-only Christianity. Most people have not rejected biblical Christianity, because most people have never seen biblical Christianity. They've seen Christian entertainment, they've seen hipster Christians, they've seen telivangelists, they've seen walking caricatures of what Christians are supposed to be. It is very hard to argue with someone who lives every day like God is real and who is giving their life as a living sacrifice to Him. It's really hard for liberals to argue with a Christian giving themselves to the poor or showing genuine compassion to all people. You must really be different to make a difference, and nothing is more radically different than a biblical Christian. So step number one: let's make Christianity real.<br />
My <strong>second step</strong> to taking back america is just as simple, <strong>make friends with a liberal</strong>. Go to a local college and befriend a professor. Take time to get to know your Starbucks barista. Stop hiding inside the walls of the church and get out and actually meet and befriend people who are different than you. Don't do this with an agenda. Don't drown them in political rhetoric. Be their genuine friend. Listen to them. Think about their ideas. Find out what is important to them. Seek common ground. In all of this, don't hide your Christianity from them. Talk about what God means to you, and after a friendship is established, talk with them about the gospel.<br />
The <strong>third</strong> thing to do is <strong>rejoice in those who accept Christ.</strong> It won't be all or even most of the people you befriend, but it will be some. God has promised that when we share the gospel, some will be saved. The problem for most of us is we've become so divided and isolated that we don't share it. When you don't know any people "on the other side" it's very hard to be a genuine witness to them.<br />
What about those who don't believe. Still be their genuine friend. Still spend time with them. Continue to love them. You may eventually win them to Christ and you may not, but you will definitely unsettle their preconceived notions about Christians.<br />
The new <em>"status quo"</em> is a very different America. We need to wake up and realize that it is not about winning elections anymore, its about winning people, and we can't keep doing what we've been doing and expect to do that.</p></p>
