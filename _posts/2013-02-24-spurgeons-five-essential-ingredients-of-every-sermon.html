<p>I&rsquo;ve read a lot of books about preaching. I am always looking for help with my preaching, and I know I am a long way off from being really good at it. There are a lot&rsquo;s of books that I&rsquo;ve personally found helpful in learning how to prepare and preach the Word, at the end of this post, I'll list some of my favorites.</p>
<h3 id="thebestthingonpreachingiveeverread.">The best thing on preaching I&rsquo;ve ever read.</h3><br />
<a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/charles-spurgeon-recipe1.jpg"><img alt="charles spurgeon recipe1" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/charles-spurgeon-recipe1-300x150.jpg" width="300" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>If I had to say the one thing I&rsquo;ve read that has made the biggest impression on how I view preaching, it is actually one chapter in&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;An All Around Ministry&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;that I first read as a freshman in college called&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Light, Fire, Faith, Life, Love&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;in which Charles Spurgeon gave the five ingredients he thought should be in every preacher. (I bet you can&rsquo;t guess what they are.)</p>
<p>The chapter is freely available&nbsp;<a href="http://www.godrules.net/library/spurgeon/NEWspurgeon_c8.htm">here</a>. It is well worth the ten minutes it takes to read, and will be infinitely more valuable than anything that I can say about it.</p>
<p>This week, as much for my benefit as anybody else&rsquo;s, I am going to take these &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; one at a time, pick out some of Charles Spurgeon&rsquo;s golden nuggets and write about how I try to apply them to my life and preaching.</p>
<p>The Ingredients are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Fire</li>
<li>Faith</li>
<li>Life</li>
<li>Love</li><br />
</ul><br />
