<h1>Two Schools of Thought</h1><br />
When it comes to commentaries among independent Baptists, it seems there are two schools of thought:</p>
<h3>Group 1</h3><br />
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t use commentaries, or use them very rarely, because we don&rsquo;t want to pervert the scripture with man&rsquo;s wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Group 2</h3><br />
&ldquo;Commentaries are great, and we wouldn&rsquo;t go into the pulpit without consulting some of them.&rdquo;</p>
<h1>Why I use commentaries:</h1><br />
I'm definitely a group 2 guy - here is why:</p>
<h3>The Bible isn&rsquo;t subjective.</h3><br />
You&rsquo;ve probably been to (or at least seen one on tv) the literature class where the teacher asks the students &ldquo;What does it mean to you.&rdquo; When it comes to Bible study - <strong>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what it means to you - it matters what it means</strong>. God&rsquo;s word isn&rsquo;t given to private interpretation.</p>
<p>I think most Bible believing preachers despise the post-modern &ldquo;there is no truth, only what&rsquo;s true to you&rdquo; mentality prevalent in modern society. Yet many Bible believing preachers (and not just young ones) bring that same mentality into their Bible study.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s word has one (and in rare cases such as prophecy maybe two or three) intended meaning(s).</p>
<h3>Christians have been studying God&rsquo;s word for millenia</h3><br />
Think about this: if God&rsquo;s word has an intended meaning and purpose, and if Christians have been studying God&rsquo;s word for millenia - doesn&rsquo;t it follow that probably, at some point, they understood that meaning? Can we balk when liberal judges separate themselves from history to see something new in the U.S. Constitution but then go and do the same thing to a document far more precious than the U.S. Constitution? Isn&rsquo;t it kind of arrogant, and the opposite of #oldpaths to assume that you are going to have a better understanding of the text than the majority of the Christians throughout history?</p>
<h3>I don&rsquo;t trust my own mind and heart</h3><br />
The Bible says that the heart (which in Bible times was seen as the seat of both thinking and feeling) is deceitful and desperately wicked. If you&rsquo;ve ever bought something you had to have but later realized you didn&rsquo;t need &mdash; then you know you have the capacity for self-deception.</p>
<p>What would make me think I would be any less prone to deceive myself as I study the scriptures? Absent the teaching of other believers, what&rsquo;s to keep me from bringing my own agenda to the scriptures and reading my own preconceived ideas into the scriptures?</p>
<h3>Commentaries introduce valuable insights into context and language.</h3><br />
As a busy pastor, I don&rsquo;t always have time to check Josephus or to crack open my trusty TR when I&rsquo;m preparing to preach. That kind of research is seriously time consuming. I can, however, glean from the research of other trusted men who have made that study their life&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h1>Why you don't:</h1><br />
A lot of preachers don&rsquo;t like commentaries. If that&rsquo;s you, despite what you may say - I think most of you are doing it for one of these five reasons:</p>
<h3>You got some bad training.</h3><br />
This is the best case scenario. They had some preacher or Bible college teacher who they trusted and who fit into one of the categories below who told them to stay away from commentaries. So they listened. If this is you - don&rsquo;t beat yourself up over it. Just think through it and give commentaries a try.</p>
<h3>You don&rsquo;t like to study.</h3><br />
Some preachers don&rsquo;t like to read commentaries because they don&rsquo;t like to read anything. Some of the most obviously ignorant and worst read people I know are called &ldquo;pastor&rdquo; somewhere. If you are called to preach - you are called to study, so start learning to like it now.</p>
<h3>You don&rsquo;t like to submit.</h3><br />
I&rsquo;m afraid this is the main reason for most people. Many preachers enjoy the freedom of thinking the passage is about whatever they want it to be about. They don&rsquo;t want to submit to the collective wisdom of historical understanding because, as one preacher put it &ldquo;a little bit of study ruins a lot of good preaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being ignorant of something doesn&rsquo;t make it any less true, and your unwillingness to compare your take on a passage with the Bible students throughout history more likely means they are right and you are wrong.</p>
<h3>You are protecting some bad practice or idea.</h3><br />
When you start to read what Christian teachers throughout history have said about the Bible - it starts to reveal your own unscriptural emphasis. You aren&rsquo;t going to find a lot of preaching and teaching about your little pet issues in commentaries and you aren&rsquo;t going to confirm the list of ten things that press your amen button.</p>
<h3>You want to look like the spiritual poobah.</h3><br />
Maybe you enjoy getting up in front of a group and saying &ldquo;I saw something here I don&rsquo;t think anyone has ever seen before.&rdquo; Or you get a sense of enjoyment about showing how some number here and some comma there means this or that - when no one has ever said that before. You want to look like a mystic getting some kind of quasi-direct revelation from God. (Which means the revelation God gave in the first place isn&rsquo;t good enough.)</p>
<hr />
<p>So why do I think people don&rsquo;t like commentaries? Let me make it real simple: ignorance, laziness, stubbornness and pride.</p>
<p>If that stings - there is a real simple solution: <strong>study</strong>.</p>
<p>Study the Bible with sound hermeneutical practice and far more often than not - commentaries will confirm your study. (If you don&rsquo;t know what sound hermeneutical practice is - I suggest a good place to start is a book like &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Applying-Bible-Revised-Expanded/dp/0802490921/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436363195&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=understanding+and+applying+the+bible">Understanding and Applying the Bible</a>&rdquo; by McQuilkin or the writings of preachers like Spurgeon, F.B. Meyer, Campbell Morgan or Martyn Lloyd Jones.) It isn&rsquo;t as easy as divining some special meaning from the text - but getting the Bible right so it&rsquo;s actually the Bible we are giving is worth a little effort.</p>
