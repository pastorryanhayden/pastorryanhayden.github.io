<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Plan out expository sermon series well in advance.</h3><br />
One of the things that has helped me immensely is to plan out my sermons by series well in advance of when I preach.&nbsp; The main reason I do this is because it gives me a plan of study that keeps me from wondering off into tangent sermons.&nbsp; I have found this idea of planning to be super useful not just for preaching but for teaching as well, I plan out every lecture for the whole year when I have to teach a course and it takes something big and makes it small enough to handle.</p>
<p>Some would say that this level of planning hinders the work of the Holy Spirit, but I would say the opposite is true.&nbsp; I have found that the planned sermons are just what I need and just what the congregation needs.&nbsp; No one can complain that I am picking on them if I preach on something going on now, because I planned out the sermon six months ago.</li></p>
<li>
<h3>Read, re-read, and re-reread the passage.&nbsp; Write down any ideas that come to mind as Evernote notes.</h3><br />
About a week before I need to preach a sermon, I start to read and reread the passage of scripture that I am preaching on.&nbsp; I do this during a separate time from my personal devotions.&nbsp; Usually, after I have read a passage through several times, some idea of how to best present the theme or truth in the passage comes to mind and I write in down in Evernote.</p>
<p>I almost never use the first outline that comes to mind, it usually takes me several revisions.&nbsp; I can access both my notes on the passage and the passage itself via my iPad pretty much wherever I am at.</li></p>
<li>
<h3>Read (or listen to) relevant material on the subject from other men.</h3><br />
After I have read a passage through a sufficient number of times to get the feel for the passage myself, I will read some commentaries and listen to others preach on the passage.&nbsp; I love sermonaudio.com for this, as I can look up sermons by passage.&nbsp; Sometimes, I will listen to sermons or read commentaries that I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend to just anybody.</p>
<p>All the while as I am doing this I will continue to put notes into Evernote.&nbsp; After a few days I will have quite a large number of little text files containing outline idea, quotes and relevant cultural and historical information.</li></p>
<li>
<h3>Write out a full sermon manuscript.</h3><br />
My next step is to write out a sermon manuscript.&nbsp; I&nbsp; am not a manuscript preacher, but I do not feel prepared unless I have a full manuscript written out.&nbsp; I rarely say all that I have written, and almost always veer off of my manuscript while preaching, but I still think this stage is invaluable.&nbsp; Joseph Parker said that if you don&rsquo;t know what you are going to say before you preach, you probably won&rsquo;t know what you said when you are finished (and your congregation won&rsquo;t either.)</p>
<p>While manuscript writing is hard work, it doesn&rsquo;t take nearly as much time as reading and ideating about the text.&nbsp; When I have done steps two and three correctly, usally the manuscript just comes together.</p>
<p>(I am very careful to write a manuscript as a speaker and not as a writer.&nbsp; I avoid long sentences&nbsp; and big words, because as I am speaking people can&rsquo;t reread a sentence or examine the context of a word.&nbsp; I try to close my eyes and type as I would speak, that may be the most valuable part of this step.)</li></p>
<li>
<h3>Winnow down my manuscript to the essentials and print it out to preach.</h3><br />
I don&rsquo;t like to use a manuscript as I speak.&nbsp; I find that having something to read will make me a reader and not a preacher (the manuscript for me is a crutch, and I can&rsquo;t have it in front of me.)&nbsp; So a day or so after the manuscript has been written, I will read it, make any changes that need&nbsp; to be made and type out an outline that contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scripture references that need to be read</li>
<li>Quotes I don&rsquo;t want to mess up</li>
<li>Sentences I don&rsquo;t want to omit</li>
<li>The outline</li><br />
</ul><br />
</li><br />
</ol><br />
</ol></p>
<p>When this if finished I print it off , fold it in my Bible (which I only use for preaching) and open it again when I am ready to preach.</p></p>
