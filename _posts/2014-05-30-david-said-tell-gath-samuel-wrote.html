<p><em>Update: Someone pointed out to me that the Amalekite in this chapter was probably posing. &nbsp;After reading some commentaries, I've changed the first two paragraphs. &nbsp;It has little to do with the main point I was trying to make.</em></p>
<p>2 Samuel 1 is an interesting chapter. David is still on the run. A&nbsp;man posing as an&nbsp;Amalekite comes to him and tells how he came upon Saul and his armor bearer, after they had already committed suicide. According to this man, Saul, in agony, begged this Amalekite to put him out of his misery, and the Amalekite, knowing there was no way Saul could live anyways, did that, then hasted to bring Saul's crown and jewelry to David. (Comparing 1 Samuel 31 with 2 Samuel 1 and looking at it closely, everything about this guy is sketchy. &nbsp;He probably wasn't even an Amalekite.)</p>
<p>David hears the man's story, and after a period of fasting has this man killed for <em>"touching the Lord's anointed."</em> Then waxes poetic saying things like <em>"how are the mighty fallen"</em> and <em>"tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon."</em></p>
<p>David had lost his king and his best friend, and was in mourning. &nbsp;He expressed a desire in poetry to honor his friend and his king, and to not allow their death to be a cause for rejoicing among his enemies.</p>
<p>Even though David's word's had nothing to do with Saul's sins (he was just expressing a desire to not see the Philistines rejoice over this) people have used David's words about Saul as an excuse to hush&nbsp;all negative comments about past leaders.</p>
<p><em>But here's the thing. We can read about it.</em> We can read about Saul's repeated disobedience, his attempts to kill David and his visit to the witch. We can read about David's going to the Philistines, we can read about David's immorality and we can read about his family problems.</p>
<p><strong>David said <em>"tell it not in Gath"</em> but Samuel wrote it down.</strong>&nbsp;(Or whoever wrote 2 Samuel 1) Because Samuel wrote it down, we can learn about it and we can learn from it.</p>
<p>There is, among us independent Baptists, a strong resistance to publishing anything negative about past leaders. I understand where that is coming from. There are pastors alive who knew those men and who benefited from or were even saved under their ministries. They have an appropriate sense of loyalty to them, and don't want to see their name tarnished. Also, there are men who just think the publishing of the failures of past leaders will give the enemies of the cause of Christ, or at least the enemies of the independent Baptist movement, cause to rejoice.</p>
<p>But Samuel wrote it down and published it, and we believe that it was Holy Spirit inspired just as much as Genesis 1:1 and John 3:16.</p>
<p>2 Samuel is a part of a huge swath of the Bible that can only be categorized as History. Biblical history doesn't glorify men as supermen (like David did to Saul and Jonathan) but portrays men as they were, lumps and all. It doesn't do this so that we can just have an accurate record, it does this so that we can learn from both the positive and the negative aspects of people's lives.</p>
<p>We've all heard the quote, attributed to a dozen men, <strong>"Those who don't learn from their past are doomed to repeat it."</strong> Most of us understand the importance of history. Yet, in the independent Baptist movement, their is a strong resistance to anything but glowing tributes being published about past leaders.</p>
<p>At some point, Frank Norris, John R. Rice, Lee Robberson, Jack Hyles, and other past leaders have to move into history. These men are dead, but like all great historical figures, they aren't dead. They are alive in the same sense that Thomas Jefferson, John Calvin, Martin Luther, and Ronald Reagan are still alive. They live through their influence.</p>
<p>Much of their influence is positive. They cast a long shadow on us for things like soul-winning, zeal for truth, and willingness to stand for what is right. That positive side needs to be told.</p>
<p>But some of their influence was negative. Just as some of your influence will be negative and some of my influence will be negative. We are human beings, we make mistakes. We can be both people's example for right and their excuse for wrong.</p>
<p>By making anything negative about past leaders taboo - we are buttressing their negative influence and giving another generation an excuse. What may be worse, we are removing from people any hope of understanding how our movement got to where it is today.</p>
<p>Saul is not in heaven today seeking worship, he is not there saying "don't tell another person what I did." I think, based on what the Bible teaches, he's up there patting Samuel on the back and saying "thanks for writing that down, I sure hope others don't make the same mistakes I made." I tend to think that Rice, Hyles and company have the same attitude.</p>
<p>Samuel wrote it down. God put it in the Bible. History is not inconsequential. Leaders live on through their influence. It might hurt our cause if the people in Gath learn about the shortcomings of our heroes, but it will hurt it more if future generations don't hear about them, and lose&nbsp;the opportunity to learn from them so they don't repeat them.</p>
<h4>Three&nbsp;Necessary Clarifications</h4></p>
<ul>
<li>It is not my attention to compare Rice, Hyles, Robberson or Norris to King Saul. &nbsp;I merely was working off the principle that our respect for authorities (like Saul) shouldn't lead us to repress their stories and keep others from learning from them.</li>
<li>Personally, when I talk about publishing the history of Christian leaders, I'm more concerned with their practices and positions than I am rumors about their private lives. &nbsp;In other words, I'm not saying we should dwell on scandals, I'm saying we should take an open and honest look at what they did regularly and what they stood for.</li>
<li>I want to reiterate that David's words had nothing to do with Saul's sins. &nbsp;This isn't a commentary of 2 Samuel one, it is a commentary on the character of the historical books.</li><br />
