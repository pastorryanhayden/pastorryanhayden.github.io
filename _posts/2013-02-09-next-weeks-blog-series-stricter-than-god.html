<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Amish_Hats_And_Coats_by_imtay22.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-594" alt="Amish_Hats_And_Coats_by_imtay22" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/Amish_Hats_And_Coats_by_imtay22-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Last Sunday I preached from Matthew 12, where Jesus and the Pharisees butted heads over their interpretation of the sabbath. &nbsp;The Pharisees took a much stricter view of it than Jesus did. &nbsp;Which got me thinking, is it possible to be stricter than God?</p>
<p>Many Independent Baptists spend a lot of time arguing and defending standards that don't come directly from scripture, could it be they stricter than God?</p>
<p>Yet all of us know that we have to have some rules that aren't in scripture. &nbsp;"I can't tell my child to not cross a busy street because that rule's not in the Bible." <strong>said no parent ever</strong>. &nbsp;How does this all work out?</p>
<p>I plan to cover these topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wp.me/p2cxH4-9O">Are Indpendent Baptists stricter than God?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wp.me/p2cxH4-a0">What's the matter with extra-biblical rules?</a></li>
<li><a title="Stricter than God: What it says about our view of scripture." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/stricter-than-god-what-it-says-about-our-view-of-scripture/">What does it say about our relationship with scripture when we are stricter than God?</a></li>
<li><a title="Stricter than God: What it says about our God and our Religion." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/stricter-than-god-what-it-says-about-our-god-and-our-religion/">How does it portray God and Christianity when we are stricter than God?</a></li>
<li>Why am I writing this series?</li><br />
</ul><br />
I realize I may have bitten off way more than I can chew with these topics, but one of the reasons I blog is because it forces me to think through topics.</p>
