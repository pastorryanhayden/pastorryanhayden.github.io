<p>I've been doing a lot of web design work lately (and thus, not a lot of blogging.) &nbsp;As a part of a project I'm working on, I've created a long manual on how to use a free online program called Canva to make slider images for your home page.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/How_to_use_Canva_for_your_web_site_Sliders_-_Google_Docs.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1969" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/How_to_use_Canva_for_your_web_site_Sliders_-_Google_Docs-300x170.jpg" alt="How_to_use_Canva_for_your_web_site_Sliders_-_Google_Docs" width="300" height="170" /></a></p>
<p>Slider images are one of the trickiest things to teach clients how to make because they invariably require using some kind of graphic design software. &nbsp;You won't find anything easier than Canva.</p>
<p>So I'm going to share that file via my blog for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want pastors to know how to use Canva to do some basic graphic design projects.</li>
<li>I want prospective web design clients to see the kind of training material I include with my web work.</li><br />
</ol><br />
Check out the link to the google doc below <em>(Warning, some of it, like the dimensions, is web site specific.)</em></p>
