<p>I'm preaching this week from <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians14" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 14</a>, a chapter where Paul makes the case that the gift of prophecy (preaching) is more important than the gift of tongues. Paul gives two reasons why preaching is superior to tongues, and I think both of them are extremely instructive as to the kind of preaching we should be doing.</p>
<p>The first reason he gives is:</p>
<h2>Preaching builds up the church.</h2><br />
He says in verse 4:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church."</em></blockquote><br />
The word "edify" is translated from the greek word transliterated "<em>oikodomeō</em>." <em>Oikodomeō</em> was the greek word for construction worker. It's translated "build" or "builder" far more times than it is translated "edify." I imagine little greek kids asking their moms for "Bob the <em>oikodomeō</em>" toys at Christmas time. So "edify" means build. That meaning has even seeped into english - sometimes we call a building an "edifice."</p>
<p>And here is the thing about building, it's not done all at once. The old saying goes "Rome wasn't built in a day." Well, I don't know much that can be built in a day - even with modern power tools. We've been working on a modest remodel of our church basement and it's gone on for months.</p>
<p>The second reason Paul gave that preaching is superior to tongues speaking is:</p>
<h2>Preaching is understandable.</h2><br />
He said in verse 19:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."</em></blockquote><br />
The importance of understanding actually runs throughout the whole chapter, and is probably Paul's strongest case against the kind of tongues speaking that was going on in Corinth. Preaching is thus better than tongues because people can't understand tongues, but they can understand preaching.</p>
<h2>Applied today.</h2><br />
I don't run in charismatic circles - so I don't know anyone struggling with tongues speaking. It's hard to make an application there.</p>
<p>I have known people to have some really bad ideas about preaching.</p>
<p>Ever thought about preaching a "home run" or "a grand slam" sermon? Ever heard a preacher yell from the sermon's beginning to it's end, barely taking time to breath? Ever heard a preacher that seems to judge a sermon by the emotions he can work up within people?</p>
<p>I have. I've been that guy on all three accounts. (Or at least tried to be.)</p>
<p>Here's the thing though - that kind of preaching doesn't aim to edify and it discounts understanding.</p>
<p>You don't build a house with one single swing of a hammer, you build a house board by board, brick by brick.</p>
<p>You don't get people to understand what you are saying by yelling at them - you get them to understand by communicating with them. Trust me, people check out after about thirty seconds of the constant yell stuff.</p>
<p>People need preaching. That cannot be denied, but they need the right type of preaching. And what is the right type of preaching?</p>
<p>I think based on this passage, a case could be made that the right type of preaching is - <strong>incremental Bible preaching aimed at the understanding.</strong></p>
<p>Preach to the will, yes, but preach to the will through the understanding. Preach with passion, yes, but preach to the understanding.</p>
<p>You may scoff at "teachy preaching" - but teachy preaching is biblical preaching. Anything else may be, just like tongues, nothing but show and a waste of time.</p>
