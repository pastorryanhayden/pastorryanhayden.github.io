<p>I believe the time has come for us to take a stand against unbiblical preaching methods. When someone has a view of salvation that differs from the Bible - we stand against it because we know it's consequences could damn them to hell. When someone has an unbiblical view of marriage, we stand against it because we know that it will have consequences in broken homes. For some reason, however, we don't tend to stand against unbiblical methods of ministry with quite the same fervor, and I believe we are reaping the results of that in independent Baptist churches.</p>
<p>Let me define what I mean by unbiblical preaching. I believe that the text should direct the sermon. Preaching should be little more than reading the scripture, explaining what it says, and applying that to the lives of our hearers. That means preaching a text in the context that God gave it to us.</p>
<p>While I would never say a preacher should only preach expository sermon series through books of the Bible (topical and textual preaching should be used as well, but they should apply the text in it's original contextual meaning), I think it is virtually impossible to proclaim <em>"the whole council of God"</em> without preaching through books of the Bible. God inspired all scripture, God has made scripture profitable that the man of God may be perfect, and I believe that God wants Christians to be exposed to all scripture.</p>
<p>So what are the dangers when a preacher doesn't allow the context to direct the application or doesn't take the time to teach through Bible books? I believe there are at least five of them:</p>
<h2>1. The danger of skipping</h2><br />
The most obvious danger of not allowing the Bible to direct your preaching is skipping over things that God intends the church to hear. Doctrinal shallowness and terrible practice both fester when a preacher picks and chooses the scripture which the church is to be exposed to. Joel Osteen can preach Sunday after Sunday without saying a controversial thing or ever dealing with sin because he picks and chooses what he wants to preach to people. While our theology might keep us from doing the same thing, we are inevitably going to skip over parts of the Bible we are uncomfortable with and rob people of instruction God intended.</p>
<h2>2. The danger of over-simplifying</h2><br />
Along with the danger of skipping scripture is the danger of over-simplifying God's plan for the Christian life. When we pick and choose what texts we are going to preach, we will inevitably settle on a small number of topics that we feel are important. Human nature dictates that we are going to preach on the things that we feel are easy (both to understand and to do) and we'll end up with an idea of the Christian life that barely resembles its source.</p>
<p>I hate to play the Pharisee card, but this is exactly what they had done with the Old Testament. They had skipped over the weightier matters of the law, the matters of the heart, and focused on those that could be objectified. The result was shallow hypocrisy.</p>
<h2>3. The danger of making yourself the authority.</h2><br />
If we don't allow the text to dictate our preaching, then what <em>is</em> dictating our preaching? We are. It's a subtle shift, but it moves the authority from the Word of God to the preacher. I strongly believe that is authority that we were not meant to hold.</p>
<p>So much preaching today <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Isaiah66" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">is 90</a>% the preacher's opinion and 10% scripture. The real shame in that is that the preacher's opinion is presented <em>as</em> scripture. If you can't see how that inevitably hurts people, you need to get your glasses fixed.</p>
<h2>4. The danger of bullying</h2><br />
When the preacher isn't allowing the scripture to direct his preaching, he might be tempted to use the pulpit to deal with personal problems in the church. When he feels like someone is challenging him, he might preach on gossip or criticism or loyalty. Usually, this doesn't end with anything but hurt feelings.</p>
<p>I have found that if you allow the text to direct the preaching, then God will deal with problems in the church. I've been amazed at how often the text has me deal with divorce or jealousy just when it is needed in the church. But because I do it as part of a set preaching schedule, no one thinks I'm stepping on their toes or singling them out.</p>
<h2>5. The danger of twisting.</h2><br />
The last danger of not allowing the Bible to direct your preaching is the danger of twisting the meaning of scripture. This has become common practice. Often, in defense or presentation of a simplistic idea, they will present a snippet of a verse out of context and "go to seed" on that.</p>
<p>Ignoring for a minute the ethical quandary you put yourself in when you twist God's Words, you are eventually setting yourself up for failure when you twist God's Words. This will only work as long as your hearers don't look deeper at the text, but when they do and see what you've done, you'll have thrown into question your credibility and ruined your authority.</p>
