<p>When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with clothes. Me and my friends would take trips to the mall every week and I would pour over GQ magazine or Brooks Brother&rsquo;s catalogue. Before I graduated from college, I had probably read at least three &ldquo;dress for success&rdquo; type books and prided myself on owning five suits (I probably have twelve now). I once even bought a brand new pair of Johnston and Murphy oxfords on a trip to Boston and insisted on wearing them all day (until I had to go buy sandals because of the blisters.) For most of my adult life, going to church has been THE opportunity of the week to look &ldquo;crisp.&rdquo; Saying I dressed up for church is an understatement.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, however, I have begun to feel like the act of trying to &ldquo;dress to the nines&rdquo; in the church house is just <em>silly</em>. I live in a predominately blue-collar city that is surrounded by corn fields for fifty miles in every direction. The people in my community don&rsquo;t do fancy. Unless you catch the dismissal of the local apostolic assembly, you are twice as likely to run into an Amish person at the local Wal-Mart as you are to run into someone in a nice suit. My fancy suits, my cuff links, my shirts from Jermyn Street in London, they just make me feel like I&rsquo;m showing off.</p>

<p>Then I open the Bible and look for any command to &ldquo;dress our best for the Lord&rdquo; and I find it <strong>completely absent</strong>. What I do find is an admonition for woman not to adorn themselves with <em>&ldquo;costly apparel.&rdquo;</em> I find that James blasts the church for respecting people in <em>&ldquo;gay clothing&rdquo;</em> while disrespecting people in <em>&ldquo;vile raiment.&rdquo;</em> I find that Jesus took the Pharisees to task because <em>&ldquo;they made wide their phylacteries.&rdquo;</em> I find in the Old Testament when people wanted to get serious with the Lord, they took their ornaments off. But the &ldquo;dress your best for the Lord&rdquo; bit, it&rsquo;s conspicuously not there.</p>
<p>So should we dress up for church?</p>
<p>My opinion: <strong>Yes and no.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I do not think church should be a dress up competition.</strong> I do not think that we should dress in such a way that outsiders to our church think that we are flaunting money. I do not think that we should give people the impression that we have some kind of Christian dress code, and that if you show up for church on Sunday morning in less than a suit and tie you are obviously not a part of the church. The &ldquo;dress up for church&rdquo; position has a lot of potential pitfalls, and not enough redeeming graces.</p>
<p>So should we <strong>dress down</strong> for church? Absolutely not. I find it kind of disturbing that our culture still expects people to wear business attire to the office or a neat uniform to their retail or burger flipping job but is increasingly encouraging people to wear shorts and flip-flops to church on Sunday. The Bible nowhere says &ldquo;dress up for church&rdquo; but it also nowhere says &ldquo;come to church in your sweat pants and crocs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So what should be our operating principle be when we get dressed for church?</p>
<p>I think it should be <strong>respect.</strong></p>
<p>When I go golfing (about once a decade). I&rsquo;m always surprised to find that golf courses still have a collared shirt, no denim policy. Most of the retail stores and restaurant chains still expect their employees to wear khaki pants and a collared shirt. The desk employees where I get my oil changed wear a tie. Are they showing off? No. Somebody along the line figured out that, in our american culture, such attire shows a certain level of <em>respect</em>. Respect for the job. Respect for yourself. Respect for those you serve.</p>
<p>When I come into the church house I am not there to show people how well I can dress. I don&rsquo;t go to my closet on Sunday morning and think &ldquo;I need to dress my very best.&rdquo; My very best is overkill. That&rsquo;s all about me. But I also don&rsquo;t go to my closet and think &ldquo;I want to be as comfortable as possible today,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t put on my kicking around-the-house clothes, that would be all about me too. I put on modest dress clothes because it shows a level of respect for my congregants, respect for my office, and respect for being in a place to worship God.</p>
<p>I know that this verse primarily deals with tongues in the church, but the Bible still says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Let all things be done decently and in order.</em> (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians14%3A40" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>)</blockquote><br />
Most of our church people don&rsquo;t wear suits. Often, our ushers are wearing a button down camp shirt and khaki pants. I&rsquo;ve never thought twice about it. But if our ushers came to church in greasy jeans and an old t-shirt, I&rsquo;d say they probably should put on something that shows a little more respect for their role in the worship service.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Has anybody else had a change of mind about these things? Let me know in the comments.</p>
