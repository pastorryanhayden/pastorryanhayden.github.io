<p>Over the last couple of days, I&rsquo;ve been listening to a couple of sermons by Dr. Les Ollila from <a href="http://www.colonialindy.org/crossroads-conference.html">&ldquo;The Crossroads Conference.&rdquo;</a> I don&rsquo;t know Dr. O. (Although my old pastor spoke very highly of him.) I&rsquo;ve had no exposure to Northland and thus I&rsquo;m not prepared to comment on all that is going on there now. I&rsquo;m just saying that these two messages are awesome.</p>
<p><a class="fancybox" title="" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-06-21-at-7.49.23-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1280" alt="Screen Shot 2013-06-21 at 7.49.23 AM" src="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-06-21-at-7.49.23-AM.png" width="491" height="335" /></a></p>
<p>I especially enjoyed the one entitled<em> &ldquo;A Good Legacy Does Not Guarantee a Good Future&rdquo;</em>. In it, Dr. Ollila made an off the cuff remark about our generation that I found cuts to the core:</p>
<blockquote><p>Toughness isn&rsquo;t legalism - that&rsquo;s called life. Isn&rsquo;t it amazing that anything where I have to say no to me suddenly becomes legalism. Where in the world does that come from? Getting out of bed in the morning isn&rsquo;t legalism, that&rsquo;s called life.</blockquote><br />
I believe there is such a thing as legalism and it is more than the straw man definition of using works for salvation. You can&rsquo;t sum up the Christian life with a checklist. &nbsp;Legitimate legalism needs to be pointed out.</p>
<p>That admitted, I also think legalism may be the most overused and misunderstood term today (liberty coming in a close second.) A lifestyle of hedonism or epicureanism can conveniently hide behind accusations of legalism. It&rsquo;s all too easy to look at any behavior which is difficult or which could bring us opposition from the world, label it legalism, and never wrestle with the hard things of the Christian life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear from scripture that the Christian life is meant to be many things, but the modern american kind of easy probably isn&rsquo;t one of them. We are in warfare, not on welfare. My own heart is convicted about how I often explain away my easy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Anyways, they&rsquo;re good messages and I commend them to you. You can find them here:</p>
