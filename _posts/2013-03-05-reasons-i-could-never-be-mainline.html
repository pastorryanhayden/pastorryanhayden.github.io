<p>In the past few weeks, my blog has generated a lot of attention. My <a title="Stricter Than God" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/next-weeks-blog-series-stricter-than-god/">&ldquo;Stricter than God&rdquo;</a> series was far and away the most popular thing I&rsquo;ve ever written and has generated tons of traffic. I&rsquo;m grateful for that, I really am.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m grateful for the attention. Some of the links that I&rsquo;ve received, especially from sites like &ldquo;Stuff Fundies Like&rdquo;, have made predictions about me that I don&rsquo;t appreciate. One link said that I would not be an Independent Fundamental Baptist for long if I kept asking the kind of questions I raised in &ldquo;Stricter than God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-05-at-9.26.33-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-842" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-05 at 9.26.33 PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-05-at-9.26.33-PM-300x225.png" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I can&rsquo;t control those predictions, but I can answer them.</strong> I have no plans on being anything other than an Independent Fundamental Baptist. But even if I were to want to &ldquo;jump fences&rdquo; and seek the acceptance of mainstream evangelicalism, I would not be a welcome person, mainly because of my position on the following five issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Reasons I Could Never Be Mainline: Separation" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/reasons-i-could-never-be-mainline-separation/">Ecclesiastical and Personal Separation</a></li>
<li><a title="Reasons I Could Never Be Mainline: Music" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/reasons-i-could-never-be-mainline-music/">Church music</a></li>
<li><a title="Reasons I Could Never Be Mainstream: Dress" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/reasons-i-could-never-be-mainline-dress/">Dress</a></li>
<li><a title="Reasons I Could Never Be Mainstream: The King James Issue" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/reasons-i-could-never-be-mainstream-the-king-james-issue/">Bible Versions</a></li>
<li>Church History</li><br />
</ul><br />
Starting tomorrow morning, I&rsquo;ll post one view a day.</p>
