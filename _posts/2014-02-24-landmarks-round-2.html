<p>Last friday I posted<a title="Before you preach that sermon about landmarks&hellip;" href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/preach-sermon-landmarks/"> an article about why I think the common practice of using Proverbs 22:28</a> as a jump off text to preach against change was a really bad idea. My main reason was because as I've studied both the context of the proverb and the idea of landmarks in the Old Testament, I've come to see that the proverb isn't talking about change, but rather encroaching on the disadvantaged. The exact words I used were "it's about robbing from the poor." (Which I'll admit - may have been an overgeneralization and come off a little strong.)</p>
<p>One of the regular commenters on this site, the anonymous Visitingpreacher, took a big issue with that. He said (after accusing me of misunderstanding and before accusing me of "pseudo-intellectualism) that the main meaning of this proverb was:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Don&rsquo;t be eager to change the boundaries your forefathers set up. (inferring that they probably had a reason for putting them there.)"</em></blockquote><br />
Let me give you five reasons why I still don't think that is the main interpretation of this proverbs:</p>
<h3>Reason 1 - Proverbs 23:10</h3></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:"</em></blockquote><br />
In Proverbs 23:10, we see almost the exact same phrase as 22:28 (the words "ancient" and "old" are translated from the same word.) But, that Proverb doesn't end with a command to leave the landmarks alone, it goes on to say we shouldn't enter into the field of the fatherless.</p>
<p>If you take the standard "don't change the boundaries of your forefathers" interpretation, then what could phrase 1 possibly have to do with phrase 2? We are left to come up with some kind of application like "don't be influenced by orphans" or "watch out for ideas that seem to come out of nowhere."</p>
<p>But then there is this thing called context. Verse 11 says <em>"for their redeemer is mighty, and shall plead their cause with thee."</em></p>
<p>The only logical thing to do if you take the "don't change old stuff" interpretation of 22:28 is to take a totally different interpretation of 23:10 - even though they are the exact same words.</p>
<p>I don't buy it.</p>
<h3>Reason 2 - The historical context of landmarks in the Old Testament.</h3><br />
Landmarks are not a new topic that suddenly pops up in the Proverbs 22 - they are something that is dealt with at several times in the Old Testament. In both Job and Deuteronomy, God talks about Landmarks.</p>
<p>In Deuteronomy, God pronounces a curse upon those who move landmarks. But then it adds <em>"which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it"</em> (Deut. 19:14)</p>
<p>In Job, we see "landmarks" again:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed <a>thereof</a>. 3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge. 4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together."</em> (Job 24:2-4)</blockquote><br />
Notice, that in Job landmark abuse is tied to stealing the flocks of disadvantaged people (the fatherless and widows.)</p>
<p>Here is the idea that begins to emerge - landmarks were boundary markers for actual land. Poor people were unable to defend their land and were at risk of having richer and more powerful people unjustly move their landmarks and steal their land.</p>
<h3>Reason 3 - The general context of every Old Testament passage about landmarks.</h3><br />
Deuteronomy 19:14 is the first scripture to mention landmarks, and it mentions moving landmarks in the context of fraud.</p>
<p>If you look at every other Old Testament passage that mentions landmarks. (Deut. 24, Prov. 22 &amp; 23, Job 24:2-4) They are all found within a few verses of passages about abusing the underprivileged. (Poor, widows, fatherless, etc.)</p>
<h3>Reason 4 - The agreement of most commentaries.</h3><br />
To get to this point, all you need is the cross references in your Bible, but if you look at commentaries, it confirms this.</p>
<p>I've looked, over the last several days, at every commentary I could get my hands on - some very old (like John Gill or Matthew Henry) and some newer (Like David Atkinson) and they all confirm my application. I challenged Visitingpreacher to find one commentary that supported his interpretation of Proverbs 22:28 and he never answered me.</p>
<p>In his defense, the Pulpit Commentary, after laying out in it's "interpretation" section the things I mention above, in it's "homily" section suggests a running sermon against changing things that are ancient. In my defense, the "homily" section of the Pulpit Commentary regularly spiritualizes texts and departs from a grammatical-historical interpretation and application.</p>
<p>It's been my experience that whenever you find an application of scripture agreed upon by bible believing men from various backgrounds and across several centuries, you ignore it at your own peril. (Maybe this is a case of "moving the ancient landmarks. ;))</p>
<p>So why are we commanded not to remove the landmarks? It's not for nostalgia, it's not because older equals better or "if it's new it's just not true." The reason there are commands about landmarks is because it was a tangible way to steal from the disadvantaged.</p>
<h3>Reason 5 - The subjectivity of the "don't change" application.</h3><br />
Even if none of the above was true, if <em>"remove not the ancient landmarks"</em> means <em>"don't be quick to move the boundaries your forefathers have set"</em> then it's got to be one of the most <strong>subjective commands</strong> in all of scripture.</p>
<p>Picture the following with me:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Hey Charles Spurgeon, how dare you preach in a music hall - remove not the ancient landmarks."</li>
<li>"Hey William Carey, how dare you go to India, remove not the ancient landmarks."</li>
<li>"Hey Hudson Taylor, how dare you dress like a chinaman, remove not the ancient landmarks."</li>
<li>"Hey Lee Robberson, how dare you send missionaries without the support of the convention, remove not the ancient landmarks."</li><br />
</ul><br />
Of course, we look back on all of those guys and say they were right, even though they were bucking the religious conventions and boundaries set down by their spiritual forbears. As I told Visitingpreacher, it's a command with an asterisk.</p>
<p>"Oh, well it's assumed that the ancient landmarks were good ancient landmarks in the first place."</p>
<p>Well, then it becomes the job of each generation to weigh the ancient landmarks by the light of scripture, and Proverbs 22:28 means..........nothing. It becomes totally subjective. Totally pointless. &nbsp;It takes a strong command and turns into nebulous advice.</p>
<p>Imagine if we interpreted Solomon's proverbs about alcohol that way.</p>
<p>So we have two interpretations :</p>
<p>One is favored by every other reference to "landmarks" found in the Bible, it takes history into account, it is the accepted interpretation of many generations of Bible scholars, and it's authoritative - just like it reads. Don't you dare mess with people's property lines, don't you dare steal from the widows, the fatherless and the poor.</p>
<p>The other interpretation let's you preach a barn storming message that references your preacher heroes from the 70's eighty-five times, let's you rant about whatever you want, and say things like "these painty waisted, richie-rich, preppy young preachers know more about their palm pilots than the New Testament."</p>
<p>Sorry, I'm going for interpretation number one.</p>
