<p>Looking at the Bible, the two greatest sources of insight on the dangers of being stricter than God are the interactions between Jesus and the Pharisees and between Paul and the Judiazers. Today, I want to focus on what those interactions teach us about what being stricter than God does to our religion and to the perception of God that we give off.</p>
<p>Before we do, let me again define being stricter than God. It is not applying scripture. It is not making extra-biblical rules for yourself in the application of scripture. <strong>It is majoring on and emphasizing your specific applications of scripture and your extra-biblical rules at the expense of what the Bible actually teaches.</strong> It is a particularly sneaky temptation of all who want to obey God and succumbing to it is devastating.</p>
<h2 id="isyourgodindifferentorcompassionate">Is your God indifferent or compassionate?</h2><br />
In Matthew 12, Jesus butted heads with the Pharisees twice over Sabbath laws. Once, the Pharisees took issue with his disciples picking and eating corn as they traveled through a field and the other time Jesus healed a man with a shriveled hand. Both of these have a lot to teach us about what being stricter than God tells people about the God we serve and the religion we live.</p>
<p>The Pharisees were representing a God who wanted the disciples to starve and who cared more about a ceremony than a poor handicapped man&rsquo;s wellbeing. They were representing a God who made so many sabbath rules that it was a burden that couldn&rsquo;t be born. In other words, they were representing a God that was selfish, petty and indifferent to man&rsquo;s suffering.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/haters.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-647" alt="haters" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/haters-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>But Christ was the very opposite of those things. He healed the sick, lame, and blind, raised the dead and fed the hungry. He cried over the house of Israel because they <em>&ldquo;were as sheep having no shepherd.&rdquo;</em> He died on the cross for the very people He and only He had the right to condemn.</p>
<p>Which God would you rather serve?</p>
<h2 id="isyourreligionjudgmentalorforgiving">Is your religion judgmental or forgiving</h2><br />
Another startling contrast between Jesus and the pharisees to be noticed is how they related to sinners. This is constantly brought out in the gospels and is really hard to miss. The pharisees looked at the sinners in the world around them as a battle field, with themselves being entrenched, outnumbered, and on enemy ground. Jesus looked at the sinners around Him as a mission field, and tried to reconcile them to God and righteousness.</p>
<p>Does your view of God have you throwing rocks at the adulteress or saying <em>&ldquo;neither do I condemn thee, go and sin no more?&rdquo;</em> Does your God have you dining with the publicans and sinners, sharing Christ with them or lifting your voice like a trumpet in the temple and saying <em>&ldquo;Lord, I thank thee that I am not as this publican&hellip;?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Besides dishonoring God, maybe the gravest danger of emphasizing extra-biblical rules is that it creates an &ldquo;us versus them&rdquo; mentality and leads to a judgmental self-righteousness. Sin is a lot more than skin deep, and in abridging the Word into actionable statements, we run the risk of making sinfulness (at least in our mind) some one else&rsquo;s problem. When we become the good guys, when we deserve Christ&rsquo;s atonement, then we really are the ugliest people in the world.</p>
<h2 id="areyoumadeperfectbyarulebookorarelationship">Are you made perfect by a rulebook or a relationship?</h2><br />
John 15 tells us how to be fruitful Christians. Is it through a rule book? Does John 15 give us a checklist of to-dos? No. It says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
One of the worst things that being stricter than God does to our faith is change it from something organic to something mechanic. It stops being about being and starts to be about doing.</p>
<p>How did Paul frame it in his battle with the Judiazers?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
In another instance he asked:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
But what do we do? We win people to Christ, we baptize them, and then we give them a rulebook. We demand uniformity at the expense of understanding. We lower our expectations until holiness is something attainable all by ourselves.</p>
<p>Many Christians would be surprised to know that about a third of the world&rsquo;s population dresses modestly, abstains from alcohol, reads scripture and prays every day, is faithful to attend worship and zealous to see people convert to their faith. They&rsquo;re called muslims.</p>
<p>Christianity has to be more than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that Christians be different from the world. It&rsquo;s important that we have fruit so that people can judge the root. It&rsquo;s important that Christians are holy and abstain from sin. But it&rsquo;s also very important that we don&rsquo;t emphasize a shortcut and undermine scripture, mis-portray God, and give sinners the impression that we think we are better than them. There is a lot more at stake in being &ldquo;stricter than God&rdquo; then hemlines and haircuts, what&rsquo;s at stake is a loss of biblical Christianity.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll be wrapping this series with a post about why I am writing this series.</p>
