<p>I'm posting my personal goals for 2013. One of my favorite quotations is</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He who aims at nothing always hits his mark."<br />
  I know that no one ever did great things accidentally and I believe we should aim high. I am posting these goals because I believe in the power of accountability, and I know that if all of my social media friends know of my goals, they may help me to achieve them. Without further ado, here are my personal goals for 2013:</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Get serious about being a "fisher of men." This year I plan on keeping a "prospect list" of those who I am working with, praying over it every day, and spending several hours each week reaching out to those people.</h4></li></p>
<li>
<h4>Prepare earlier. Some of the best weeks I've had this year were those weeks where I finished my sermon manuscripts for Sunday by the midweek. This year, my goal is to be ready for every Sunday by Thursday and ready for every Wednesday no later than Monday.</h4></li></p>
<li>
<h4>Finish the two books I am working on. I am in the middle of writing two books. One of them I am calling</h4></p>
<p><em>We've Got Issues. But I Wouldn't Want to Be Anybody Else.</em> and it deals with the problems of the Independent Fundamental Baptist movement and the principles that set us apart from everybody else. The second is less serious, I am working on a book called <em>10 Technology Upgrades for Pastors</em>. That gives ten simple things that pastors can do to get better use out of their tech. My goal is to have both of these books finished and published by June.</p></li></p>
<li>
<h4>Do a better job of staying in touch with my extended family. Most of my family lives 1200 miles away. The closest relatives are more like 500 miles away. I am a pretty busy guy. Unfortunately, I've used those things as an excuse to all but withdraw contact with my extended family. This year, I hope to keep regular contact with those that I love.</h4></li></p>
<li>
<h4>Start a Bible Study outreach at Eastern Illinois University. Less than ten miles away from my house is a major university with over 10,000 students. It is not a place where God's name is respected and glorified. I want to do something there to reach out to students and maybe see some of them accept Christ.</h4></li></p>
<li>
<h4>Write a blog post every week. My goal for this year is to put myself on a three week schedule and alternate a blog post between book reviews, church technology tips, and current issue rants. I really like blogging but have not done it consistently and my goal is to change that this year.</h4></li></p>
<li>
<h4>Exercise every week. I may be stick skinny, but I'm in terrible shape. I hope to spend a little time every week taking care of the only body I have.</h4></li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>If you notice that I'm falling behind on any of these goals this year, please take the time to keep me accountable.<br><br><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20130107-134635.jpg"><img src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/20130107-134635.jpg" alt="20130107-134635.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p></p>
