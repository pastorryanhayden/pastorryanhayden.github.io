<p>A couple of months ago, I started to get what seemed like the symptoms of carpel tunnel syndrome. After typing, my wrists would ache for hours. I don't consider myself to be a wimp, but it hurt. Bad. I was also starting to get back aches. It seemed like my study and work habits were at war with my body. I was beginning to understand what Paul said about much study being weary to the flesh. &nbsp;Not coincidentally, this was when I took a break from regular blogging.</p>
<p>I'm 30 years old. Lord willing, I've got a long life of pastoring ahead of me. I also write out each sermon word for word. This means I'm not going to be able to get away from sitting in a desk and I'm not going to be able to get away from typing.</p>
<p>I decided that whatever I had to do ergonomically to get away from wrist pain and back aches, I was going to do. My solution was kind of drastic.</p>
<h2>First, I rearranged my office.</h2><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1280.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1632" alt="IMG_1280" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1280-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>I'm blessed with a pretty large office, and I kept it pretty sparse anyways (I'm not the kind of guy that likes to be surrounded by books - they stay in a closet.) I was aiming to have a long section along a wall open. With a little bit of maneuvering, I made that happen.</p>
<h2>Second, I built an inexpensive standing desk.</h2><br />

<p>I found an old pine board that had been around the church and stained it, bought some cheap shelving brackets from home depot, and the cheapest monitor mount I could find (about $10 on Amazon). I wanted a place where I could type at the best possible height while standing.</p>
<h2>How I worked then.</h2><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Featured-Blog-Topics.003.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1601" alt="Featured Blog Topics.003" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Featured-Blog-Topics.003-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Before I built a standing desk, everything I did was at my desk. I read at my desk. I typed at my desk. I did design work at my desk. I slept at my desk. (Just kidding - but not really.) I spent most of my office days sitting down, usually hunkered over a keyboard and leaning forward looking at a computer.</p>
<h2>How I work now.</h2><br />
I do my studying at my sitting desk. Because it no longer has any computer paraphernalia on it, I can now spread out several books with room to spare. I found some old blank desk pads (they look like desk calendars but don't have anything written on them) around the church and now use them for taking notes from the books I'm reading. I keep several different colored pens in the desk and use the colors to keep track of the different sources I'm using. Usually, If I'm working on a sermon, I'll stay at the desk until I have a working outline and have done the research aspect of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1277.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1630" alt="IMG_1277" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1277-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Then I stand up, and don't sit down again all day.</p>
<p>I move over to my standing desk, ripping off my notes and pinning them next to me via magnets on the white board and start typing out my sermon. If my wrists start to hurt, and it doesn't happen nearly as much as it used to, I'll use the microphone and Mac OS X's built in dictation feature to dictate my manuscript. It works well for me.</p>
<p>I've noticed my back doesn't hurt anymore, and I feel like I have more energy.</p>
<p>Beyond sermons, I now do all of my graphic design, web design, podcasting and anything else that requires a computer standing up.</p>
<h2>Other tweaks I've made.</h2><br />
I've done two other things that have also boosted my productivity and made my office space a little nicer:</p>
<p>First, I keep a pair of<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crocs-Unisex-Bistro-Black-Womens/dp/B0014JKJK2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393951657&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=crocs+bistro+men"> specialty crocs</a> in my office. I did some research into the best shoes to stand up in all day, and one thing that came up over and over again was Crocs Bistro edition. These are made for chefs and nurses who have to be on their feet all day, so I went on Amazon and bought a pair for $30. (If you're a foodie - these are the ones that <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/images/Lifestyle/GTY_mario_batali_crocs_nt_131125_2x3_384.jpg">Mario Batalli wears all the time</a>.) &nbsp;They are the most comfortable pair of footwear I've ever owned - so much so that it's almost painful for me to take them off.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/crocs.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1635" alt="crocs" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/crocs-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, I found an old mini-fridge around the church property that wasn't being used for anything. I moved it into my office closet and put the Keurig I got for Christmas in there. I now make far fewer trips out of the office. &nbsp;Because I don't have a coffee maker at home anymore, I have a new incentive to get to the office early.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1282.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1634" alt="IMG_1282" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1282-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What think ye? &nbsp;Am I crazy? &nbsp;Spoiled? &nbsp;Eccentric?</p>
<p>Have any of you made any tweaks to your office or workflow that have helped you?</p>
