<p>You are reading part 6 of my series <strong>"Making Sense in the Noise Machine"</strong> my personal rules for sharing on blogs and social networks. You may want to read the introduction, and the previous posts in the series before reading this one.</p>
<h1 id="behumble">Be humble</h1><br />
One of the banes of the internet is it has made us all a bit narcissistic. We have our own little social networks that give us the opportunity to share our every waking thought with our network and are built to give us the illusion that we are the center of our own little world.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/towel.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-550" alt="towel" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/towel.jpeg" width="225" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>The internet can become a platform of unrestricted self-promotion. We can live for blog hits, for twitter followers, for Facebook friends. Social networks become the grown up, 21st century version of 7th grade lunch room politics. We can pump up our egos because of who or how many people are sitting at our virtual table.</p>
<p>While it may seem contradictory for a guy who owns his own domain name to say anything about online humility, (I bought it for an attempt at a design business years ago) I desperately want to be humble because Christ was humble. Because what I say is a reflection of who I am (see James 3), I want that humility to show through in my actual and online conversation.</p>
<p>Here are some of the guidelines I use to stay humble online:</p>
<h2 id="refusetobrag.">Refuse to brag.</h2><br />
Admit it. You go on social networks and look at fellow pastor&rsquo;s ministry and develop a spirit of envy. The internet makes it awful easy to look over people&rsquo;s fences. You read about how they had fifteen saved last week in their service and you didn&rsquo;t see fifteen saved all year. You hear about their fifteen million dollar building program and you are struggling to raise $8,000 to finish some classrooms in the basement. When we look over other pastor&rsquo;s virtual fences, it gets us down.</p>
<p>The flip side of this is the temptation to show off any good thing that happens in your ministry. While it&rsquo;s always appropriate to praise the Lord, sometimes praising the Lord is a fine mask for bragging. It&rsquo;s a fine line. I just try to be careful.</p>
<h2 id="resistcontentiousness.">Resist contentiousness.</h2><br />
I believe that contentiousness reveals a proud heart. Why? Because the Bible says so. It says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom.&rdquo;</em> Proverbs 13:10</blockquote><br />
While we are told to <em>&ldquo;earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints&rdquo;</em> (Jude 3) we are never commanded to develop spirits of contention. Quite the opposite. Scripture says in James <em>&ldquo;The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>If I feel the need to jump in and correct every error I see on the internet, it might have more to do with my pride than God&rsquo;s command to contend for the faith. I might be doing it because I like being right, because I like sounding smart, and because it&rsquo;s fun to be the intellectual bully doling out biblical beat downs in the Facebook school yard.</p>
<p>Battling for an ego victory or personal vindication and battling to help a brother come to grips with God&rsquo;s word are two totally different things and are done two totally different ways.</p>
<p>We need to check ourselves here.</p>
<h2 id="realizethatyoudontknoweverything.">Realize that you don&rsquo;t know everything.</h2><br />
There have been several times when I have been corrected by commenters, Facebook friends or even people in my church (after a sermon) and they were right. The smart thing to do in that situation is admit that we don&rsquo;t know everything, make whatever corrections you need to, and determine not to make that mistake again.</p>
<p>Sometimes the smartest answer is &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, let me check into that and get back to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humility and a willingness to learn go hand in hand. We should never give the impression that we know it all.</p>
<h2 id="rememberthatgodisworkingonothersandonyouandnoonesfinishedyet.">Remember that God is working on others (and on you) and no ones finished yet.</h2><br />
I sometimes cringe when I meet college friends I haven&rsquo;t seen in a long time because I remember what I was like in college and don&rsquo;t want to be remembered that way. I&rsquo;m no where near where I should be, but God has brought me a ways since then, and I&rsquo;m grateful for it. Some of the greatest lessons I&rsquo;ve learned have come only after God has brought me through some personal trial. He&rsquo;s still working on me (and bringing the trials.)</p>
<p>Sometimes I meet old friends and hear about how God is using them and think &ldquo;THEM?????&rdquo; I&rsquo;m still thinking of them in terms of their behavior when they were 19.</p>
<p>Many times we have a tendency to forget that God is working on others. We expect everyone to be at the level of Christian maturity that we think we are at.</p>
<p>When I see others, especially young people, post something online that shows a lack of discretion, it&rsquo;s tempting to get on their case about it or give them a black mark in my mental rolodex. The wise thing is probably to let it go and remember that 10 years ago, I probably would have done worse.</p>
<p><em>Thanks for reading this series. I hope it&rsquo;s been a blessing. I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed the five day series format and will probably keep it up. Any suggestions for future series or comments about the current one?</em></p>
