<p><em>One of my goals for 2013 is to publish a book on Tech Tips for Pastors. This book will empower Pastors with ten simple and free (or nearly free) tricks that will see them doing amazingly useful things with the technology that they already own. All of these tricks are things that I use in my ministry and I know they will fit the workflow of a small church pastor.</em> *Another goal is to write and publish a meaningful blog post every week. About once every three weeks, those two divergent goals will collide in the form of a tech tip for pastors. Today, I am releasing the first of those tech tips. * While at a preacher's fellowship lately, a fellow pastor came to me and said something like this:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have a lady in our church who can no longer attend the services. Is there any way that we can put our sermons online so that she can hear them? Oh, and is there any way that it can be free? I'm sure that there are a lot of pastors out there struggling with the same thing. I've visited at least ten church website this year with sermon pages that did absolutely nothing. This tells me two things: 1)pastors want sermons on their church website and 2) pastors have no idea how to get them there. There are several ways to get your sermons online and each of them have ups and downs:</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<h1>1. You can use a service like <a href="http://sermonaudio.com">sermonaudio.com</a>.</h1></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/pastors-tech-tip-getting-your-sermons-online-for-free/screen-shot-2013-01-08-at-6-35-11-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-342"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-342" alt="Screen Shot 2013-01-08 at 6.35.11 PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-08-at-6.35.11-PM-300x216.png" width="300" height="216" /></a> This is the option that I choose because it makes uploading sermons very easy, and because it greatly increases the exposure of those sermons. Once a sermon is uploaded to <a href="http://sermonaudio.com">sermonaudio.com</a>, I know that that sermon will be online forever (or at least till the internet dies or sermonaudio goes bankrupt) and that people who are looking for sermons online can find them. Sermonaudio provides a bit of code that can be copied and pasted into your own website that will give you a great and functional Sermons page on your website. <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/pastors-tech-tip-getting-your-sermons-online-for-free/screen-shot-2013-01-08-at-6-35-37-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-344"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-344" alt="Screen Shot 2013-01-08 at 6.35.37 PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-08-at-6.35.37-PM-300x204.png" width="300" height="204" /></a> The downside to sermonaudio is there is a sign up fee, and it costs $30 a month. Obviously, this doesn't meet the "free" criterion that my pastor friend gave me.</p></p>
<h1>2. You can live stream your services using a smart phone and either <a href="http://ustream.com">Ustream.com</a> or <a href="http://livestream.com">Livestream.com</a>.</h1></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/pastors-tech-tip-getting-your-sermons-online-for-free/screen-shot-2013-01-08-at-6-47-29-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-346"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-346" alt="Screen Shot 2013-01-08 at 6.47.29 PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-08-at-6.47.29-PM-300x258.png" width="300" height="258" /></a> This is really easy to do and will provide a video for your parishioners or potential visitors to watch of the whole service. If you have an iPhone or newer Android phone, buy a tripod mount for it (you can get these for around $10 on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stand-Tripod-Mount-Adapter-iPhone/dp/B006382XAS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357692549&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=iphone%20tripod%20mount">Amazon</a>) and position it near the front of the church. Download the free Ustream or Livestream app from your phone's App Store, sign up for an account and start it at the beginning of your church service. You can log into your <a href="http://ustream.com">ustream</a> or <a href="http://livestream.com">livestream</a> account and get a link to put on your web site that when clicked will automatically bring people to your services. &nbsp;You can view an example of this in action at my church's web site <a href="http://biblebaptistmattoon.org">www.biblebaptistmattoon.org</a>. <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/pastors-tech-tip-getting-your-sermons-online-for-free/screen-shot-2013-01-08-at-6-49-24-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-347"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-347" alt="Screen Shot 2013-01-08 at 6.49.24 PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-08-at-6.49.24-PM-300x172.png" width="300" height="172" /></a> The downside to Ustream and Livestream is that both of them are ad supported and you have no control over what ads play and when they play. Your sermon could be interrupted by a 15 second ad for a democratic congresswoman. The only way to stop this is by signing up for a ustream or livestream account, which is far more expensive than sermonaudio and will cost you over $100 a month. So if my friend can't swallow the ads, this method won't work for him either. The third method is the one that will probably work best for my friend, and the one that most people wouldn't think of, so the majority of this post will be explaining it.</p></p>
<h1>3. You can put the sermon MP3 file in a <a href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> folder, then get a public link on the Google Drive web page to copy wherever you want.</h1></p>
<p><a href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> is a free service of Google that gives you 5Gb of online storage. <strong>That translates to roughly 160 MP3 sermon files</strong>. Most people use Google Drive for backup and collaboration between computers, (If you aren't using it this way, start; it's great and it works seamlessly.) but with a little know how, you can also use Google Drive as your own personal audio host. Here is what you need to do:<br />
1.  <a href="http://drive.google.com/">Sign up</a> for Google Drive. Not only will this allow you to put your sermons on your website, you can also use this if you want to use a different computer at work and at home to work on the same files.<br />
2.  Download Google Drive for your computer. (They have downloadable apps for both Windows and Mac.) This will put a Google Drive folder in your user folder that syncs in the background over the internet. This folder is where you want to put your MP3 files. &nbsp;<a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/pastors-tech-tip-getting-your-sermons-online-for-free/screen_shot_2013-01-11_at_9-47-19_am/" rel="attachment wp-att-373"><img class="size-medium wp-image-373 alignnone" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-01-11_at_9.47.19_AM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screen_Shot_2013-01-11_at_9.47.19_AM-300x204.png" width="300" height="204" /></a><br />
3.  After you have put a sermon in that folder, wait a few minutes for the sermon to upload to Google Drive. (The icon for the file will have a little check mark on it when it's uploaded.) <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/pastors-tech-tip-getting-your-sermons-online-for-free/screen_shot_2013-01-11_at_9-48-34_am/" rel="attachment wp-att-374"><img class="size-medium wp-image-374 alignnone" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-01-11_at_9.48.34_AM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screen_Shot_2013-01-11_at_9.48.34_AM-300x283.png" width="300" height="283" /></a><br />
4.  Go back to your web browser and sign in to your Google account. (You'll see a "sign in" link at the top of google.com) then click on the &ldquo;Drive&rdquo; button at the top. <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/pastors-tech-tip-getting-your-sermons-online-for-free/screen_shot_2013-01-08_at_5-32-49_pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-376"><img class="size-medium wp-image-376 alignnone" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-01-08_at_5.32.49_PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screen_Shot_2013-01-08_at_5.32.49_PM-300x40.png" width="300" height="40" /></a><br />
5.  Find the sermon file in the list and click on the check box next to it. <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/pastors-tech-tip-getting-your-sermons-online-for-free/screen_shot_2013-01-08_at_5-32-49_pm-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-377"><img class="size-medium wp-image-377 alignnone" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-01-08_at_5.32.49_PM-2" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screen_Shot_2013-01-08_at_5.32.49_PM-2-300x40.png" width="300" height="40" /></a><br />
6.  With the file checked. Click the "Share" button directly over the file list. (It looks like a man with a plus sign next to his head.) <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/pastors-tech-tip-getting-your-sermons-online-for-free/screen-shot-2013-01-08-at-5-34-49-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-378"><img class="size-full wp-image-378 alignnone" alt="Screen Shot 2013-01-08 at 5.34.49 PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-08-at-5.34.49-PM.png" width="89" height="40" /></a><br />
7.  In the box that comes up click the &ldquo;Change...&rdquo; button underneath &ldquo;Who has access&rdquo; <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/pastors-tech-tip-getting-your-sermons-online-for-free/screen_shot_2013-01-08_at_5-36-26_pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-379"><img class="size-full wp-image-379 alignnone" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-01-08_at_5.36.26_PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screen_Shot_2013-01-08_at_5.36.26_PM.png" width="530" height="267" /></a><br />
8.  In the next dialogue box click &ldquo;Public on the Web&rdquo; and then click "save". <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/pastors-tech-tip-getting-your-sermons-online-for-free/screen_shot_2013-01-08_at_5-37-45_pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-380"><img class="size-full wp-image-380 alignnone" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-01-08_at_5.37.45_PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/Screen_Shot_2013-01-08_at_5.37.45_PM.png" width="493" height="335" /></a><br />
9.  Now select and copy the link at the top of the box. <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/pastors-tech-tip-getting-your-sermons-online-for-free/copy-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-381"><img class="size-full wp-image-381 alignnone" alt="copy-2" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/01/copy-2.png" width="530" height="267" /></a><br />
10. You can paste that link onto your website, a facebook post, or into an email and people will be able to click on it to download or play your sermon file. You could also do this using</p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> (which I also use) but they only offer 2Gb of free storage. &nbsp;I actually have both installed on my computer and use Dropbox solely for my writing projects. &nbsp;(But that's another tech tip.) New ministry tech tips will be posted each month so keep coming back. &nbsp;If you have your own methods for getting your sermons MP3 files online, please post them in the comments.</p></p>
