<p>This week, I'm posting the beliefs that I hold that, even if I wanted to be a mainstream evangelical, would keep me from being accepted. These aren't so much the distinctives of being an Independent Fundamental Baptist. But they're close. This is what I have so far:</p>

<h2>I think there is a clear case to be made from the New Testament for for people to dress in a gender distinctive way and for people to dress in a way that does not draw attention to the sexual zones of their bodies.</h2><br />
Disclaimer: <em>I'm not interested in emphasizing a Christian dress code. &nbsp;The people of my church would tell you that I mention clothes almost never in my preaching, and that's on purpose. &nbsp;I'm not interested in getting into the pants/no pants debate or anything like that. &nbsp;I think far more emphasis is placed on clothes by Christians than by scripture.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dress.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-879" alt="dress" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/03/dress-300x150.jpg" width="300" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>But, while the New Testament does not emphasize the way we dress, it&rsquo;s not silent on it either. A small portion of the New Testament epistles (the books written specifically to Christians) is about Christian practice. (About 60% of it teaches Christian doctrine.) In my mind, any specific behavior dealt with in the last half of Romans - Titus should be given special attention by Christians. Several verses in those passages deal with the way that we are to dress.</p>
<h3 id="genderdistinction">Gender Distinction</h3></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;&rdquo;</em> (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Timothy2%3A9" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Timothy 2:9</a>)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Judge in yourselves:is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.&rdquo;</em> (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians11%3A13-15" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 11:13&ndash;15</a>)</blockquote><br />
Gender distinction is not solely an Old Testament principle. It was expected in the New Testament church as well.</p>
<p>Generally, in the conversations I&rsquo;ve had with most outside of fundamentalism about these admittedly controversial and counter-cultural passages, they&rsquo;ve either 1) explained them away or 2) said that they only applied to New Testament culture. I&rsquo;m not really comfortable explaining away <em>any</em> scripture. To those who would say it was only applicable in that culture, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say, don&rsquo;t you risk invalidating and defanging all of scripture when you start interpreting it that way?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="sexualmodesty">Sexual modesty</h3></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication: That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter:because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.&rdquo;</em> (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Thessalonians4%3A3-6" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Thessalonians 4:3&ndash;6</a>)</blockquote><br />
The above passage was written to a New Testament church on the dangers of the lust of concupiscence. &ldquo;Concupiscence&rdquo; is an old word for getting sexual pleasure by what we see. It describes voyeurism.</p>
<p>The Bible is pretty clear that people can commit adultery with their eyes. (See <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Matthew5" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Matthew 5</a>) Because of that, I believe that Christians should not dress to be sexy. We should not dress in a way that draws attention to the sexual zones of our body and helps our Christian brethren to commit mental adultery or fornication.</p>
<p>[quote style="boxed"]"you say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s legalism.&rdquo; No it&rsquo;s not. They&rsquo;re commands in the Bible. It doesn&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re all supposed to dress like a Puritan, but it does say we&rsquo;re supposed to be decent and cause no offense or stumbling. &ldquo;Well you can&rsquo;t judge a book by its cover.&rdquo; Yes you can! Jesus said you can; by their fruits you will know them.&rdquo; -- Paul Washer[/quote]</p>
<p>In practice, these two ideas, those of modesty and identity, have been <strong>almost</strong>&nbsp;completely ignored outside of fundamentalism (The quote above comes from somebody outside of fundamentalism.) While I&rsquo;m not going to allow either of them to become the theme of my ministry or my application of them the measuring stick by which I judge the world, I am going to teach these things to my family and my church members, and develop family and institutional guidelines with them in mind.</p>
<p>Our society has no moral compass. &nbsp;The concepts of public decency and chastity are scorned and devalued. &nbsp;Children are given earlier and earlier access to pornography and other sexual content on the internet and tv. &nbsp;If the church isn't a safe haven where we don't have to worry about "the lust of the eyes," then what is?</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I'll be talking about why, historically speaking, an independent Baptist is &nbsp;a good place to be.</p>
