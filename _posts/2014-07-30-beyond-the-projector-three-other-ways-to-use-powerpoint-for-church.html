<p>These week, I&rsquo;ve been blogging about using <strong>PowerPoint in church</strong>. On Monday, I wrote a&nbsp;post detailing <a title="How To Use PowerPoint In Church" href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/how-to-use-powerpoint-in-church/">ways to use PowerPoint in church</a>. Tuesday, I talked about <a title="How to make church more boring with PowerPoint" href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/how-to-make-church-more-boring-with-powerpoint/">ways you definitely shouldn&rsquo;t use PowerPoint in church</a>. Keeping with that theme, today, I&rsquo;m going to give you <em><strong>three&nbsp;out of the box uses for PowerPoint in church</strong></em>. These are three things you can do with PowerPoint (or other presentation software, like Keynote) that you might not have thought of.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<h3>1. Use PowerPoint to power flat screen TVs.</h3><br />
[caption id="attachment_1933" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1943.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1933" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1943-300x225.jpg" alt="screens in Bible Baptist Church" width="300" height="225" /></a> Here is a picture of the screens in our auditorium. (No. I don't normally wear Hawaiian shirts when I preach, it was a VBS thing.)[/caption]</p>
<p>This one may seem obvious to some of you, but I&rsquo;m sure there are some who have never thought that you can use PowerPoint with a regular flat screen television.</p>
<p>I actually hate projectors for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are never as clear or as bright as televisions.</li>
<li>You have to think more about ambient light.</li>
<li>You have to fuss with distance from the screen and warmup times and keystone settings.</li>
<li>They seem like overkill in anything but a really big room.</li><br />
</ul><br />
The church I pastor has a very small auditorium with a very small platform area. I tried using a projection screen exactly once. I knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to work for us. So we purchased a 50 inch flat screen TV and ran a long HDMI cable through the wall and floor to underneath the pulpit.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1934" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/DF0531C1-9F19-4255-985B-07B4440B753A.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1934" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/DF0531C1-9F19-4255-985B-07B4440B753A-300x225.jpg" alt="Here you can see our old screen setup.  It worked, but the screen was just a little too small." width="300" height="225" /></a> Here you can see our old screen setup. It worked, but the screen was just a little too small.[/caption]</p>
<p>My favorite thing about this setup: when we weren&rsquo;t using the screen, I could just fold it up and it would almost disappear. My least favorite thing about this setup: there wasn&rsquo;t much to disappear. The screen just wasn&rsquo;t big enough for everyone in the auditorium to see.</p>
<p>So at the beginning of this year, we bought two inexpensive 60 inch plasma tvs and mounted them on either side of the pulpit. The tvs were on sale at Wal-Mart for $600 each. I bought two $20 wall mounts, a couple of long HDMI cables, and a $15 HDMI splitter from Amazon and a church member and I installed the screens in a couple of hours. The whole setup costs about $1400, which is less than one really good projector.</p>
<p>The HDMI cables run through the wall into the floor below the auditorium where they come to a HDMI splitter, a short HDMI cable runs from that splitter (which is attached to the subfloor) through the auditorium floor to the first pew. Now, I can place my laptop on the first pew and see the current and next slides as well as a timer when I&rsquo;m preaching.</p>
<p>You could do something similar in a smaller classroom with a wall mounted TV, or <a title="Rolling TV Mount" href="http://www.amazon.com/OLLO-PREMIUM-UNIVERSAL-ROLLING-TROLLEY/dp/B008D5DLZA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406729321&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rolling+tv+mount">buy a rolling mount and share a tv between several classrooms</a>. You don&rsquo;t need to have a projector.</p>
<p>Here are some photos of the installation process:</p>

<h3>2. Use PowerPoint to create a video display for your lobby.</h3><br />
About four years ago, a businessman in our church came to me with a proposition. He wanted to have a video sign for his business that played on a tv. He asked me if I&rsquo;d make it and told me he&rsquo;d pay me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an animator. I have Apple&rsquo;s Motion of my computer and have had Adobe After Effects in the past but I don&rsquo;t have the time or patience to mess with them. So I thought, why not do it in Keynote or PowerPoint?</p>
<p>I made the guy a pretty snazzy little animation video for his business and he paid me well for it and I did the entire thing inside of Keynote using basic animations like wipe and push.</p>
<p>When I became pastor here, I wanted to make a nice video missions board. I bought <a title="Jumsoft Infographics" href="http://www.jumsoft.com/infographics/">the infographics set from Jumsoft</a>. Digitized the pictures of our missionaries. Through it all together in a Keynote file with some animations and recorded the slide show with screencasting software and now have a really nice video missions display in our church lobby.</p>
<p>You can view it below:</p>

<p>And here is how it looks in our lobby:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1939" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1939" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="A 32 inch TV displaying missionaries in our church lobby." width="300" height="225" /></a> A 32 inch TV displaying missionaries in our church lobby.[/caption]</p>
<p>My point is that PowerPoint isn&rsquo;t just a good tool for making slides to use during your service, PowerPoint, paired with a spare television screen can make some really interesting animated signs or kiosks.</p>
<h3>3. Use PowerPoint to make sliders for your website.</h3><br />
You know the slider on your church website. Just about every website has one. It&rsquo;s the rectangle on your home page that &ldquo;slides&rdquo; through various pictures. The problem with those things is that you need to make photos that are EXACTLY the right aspect ratio or they don&rsquo;t look right.</p>
<p>Rather than opening up Photoshop or a similar program every time you want to update that slide, you can make a Keynote or PowerPoint presentation and set the slide size to the pixel width and height of your webslider and use a tool you are familiar with.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1941" align="alignnone" width="286"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/websliderbackground.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1941" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/websliderbackground-286x300.jpg" alt="This is how to set up a file for a website slider in Keynote." width="286" height="300" /></a> This is how to set up a file for a website slider in Keynote.[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you want to upload the slides, just find your software&rsquo;s export menu and export the slides as images. You can upload the images to your website.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1942" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Export_To_and_File_and_Menubar.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1942" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Export_To_and_File_and_Menubar-300x207.jpg" alt="This is how you export your slides as images in Keynote." width="300" height="207" /></a> This is how you export your slides as images in Keynote.[/caption]</p>
<p>If you are making church graphics in PowerPoint anyways, it&rsquo;s a fairly simple thing to drag the slide into this presentation and adjust the text so that it will look nice on your web slider.</p>
<hr />
<p>So there are three uses for PowerPoint that go beyond the traditional projector scenario. I could have included more. Believe it or not, there are people who do diagraming and brainstorming in PowerPoint or Keynote and many web designers use Keynote to wireframe their sites before they start coding them. I&rsquo;m sure there are other &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; uses for PowerPoint I&rsquo;m not thinking of. If you can think of any, let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>In the next post, I&rsquo;m going to give you five books you should buy and read if you are going to use slides in church.</p>
