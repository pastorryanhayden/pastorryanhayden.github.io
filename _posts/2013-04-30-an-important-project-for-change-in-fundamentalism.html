<p>A few weeks ago, I <a title="Mark and Avoid &ndash; Within Fundamentalism" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/mark-and-avoid-within-fundamentalism/">posted</a> about some problems that we young Independent Baptists face. I named five of them, and I said that personally, I was going to obey the command to<em> &ldquo;mark and avoid&rdquo;</em> the people who are guilty of those things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not satisfied with a single blog post, I really want to see some changes within fundamentalism and I can do very little by myself. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of some things that could be done and came to the conclusion that a huge amount of change could happen if Pastors would take a stand on three issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>abuse of the Bible</li>
<li>preacher worship</li>
<li>proud factionalism</li><br />
</ul><br />
(I really think that these three issues are foundational to just about any issue within the movement formally known as fundamentalism.)</p>
<p>In my opinion, what we really need is to <strong>draw battle lines and say</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These things are clearly condemned in scripture, they are everywhere in fundamentalism, and we aren&rsquo;t going to sit silently by and watch it anymore.&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
If fundamentalism is about staying true to the truth of God&rsquo;s Word and if those things really are condemned in scripture, I think that such a stand is wholly within the bounds of fundamentalism. In fact, I think that if you are unwilling to do so, you might as well stop calling yourself a fundamentalist.</p>
<h2 id="whativedone">What I&rsquo;ve done</h2><br />
I&rsquo;ve purchased a website &ldquo;ifbrevolution.com&rdquo; and I have started laying it out.</p>
<p>My plans are to ask pastors to do three things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Read</strong> our explanation of what the Bible says on those issues.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>Sign</strong>&rdquo; a pledge that they will take a stand against those issues. (We&rsquo;ll list in a directory all the preachers who have signed the pledge.)</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> there stand with others via social media.</li><br />
</ol><br />
Even if many pastors will not take this stand, if enough pastors do, it will do a lot to raise awareness about the biblical inappropriateness of those three things. It will force a conversation that has been needed to be had for a long time.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1126" alt="ifbrevolution logo2" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/ifbrevolution-logo2.png" width="400" height="65" /></p>
<p>It is absolutely essential that this website not veer off topic and become a sounding board for Independent Baptists to express their angst with standards, with KJV-onlyism, or anything else. If this is going to work, it cannot be seen as a bunch of kids fighting for their right to go to the movies. It&rsquo;s way bigger than that.</p>
<h2 id="howyoucanhelp">How you can help</h2><br />
I need three things to make this work.</p>
<h3 id="writers">Writers</h3><br />
I need a group of Independent Baptist pastors and missionaries who are willing to write about these three issues. What you write has to be fair, it has to be accurate, and it has to be somewhat peaceful. I&rsquo;m not so much looking for an excoriation of our past as a statement of intent for our future. I don&rsquo;t care how big your church is or how much or little you&rsquo;ve written in the past, I&rsquo;m just looking for guys who care enough about these issues to put something together and put your name on it. I want this to be way bigger than me.</p>
<h3 id="editors">Editors</h3><br />
I really struggle with grammar and spelling. Especially homonyms. I&rsquo;m looking for a couple of people who can proofread articles and pages on this site and make sure that people can&rsquo;t disqualify us because we don&rsquo;t pass the shakedown of the grammar police.</p>
<h3 id="pledgers">Pledgers</h3><br />
On of the best things you can do for us is to take the pledge once the site is &ldquo;live&rdquo; and promote it. There is strength in numbers, and it will snowball much faster if it doesn&rsquo;t go three weeks with five people pledging.</p>
<p><em>I know there are some people who will hate me for this. I know that it will be misunderstood. But I think the good it could do in our churches is well worth the risk of alienation I face. Help me. Please.</em></p>
