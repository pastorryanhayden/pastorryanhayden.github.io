<p>This week, I&rsquo;m breaking down highlights from Charles Spurgeon&rsquo;s Five Ingredients Every Preacher Needs (Found in chapter 6 of <a href="http://www.spurgeon.org/misc/aarm.htm"><em>An All Around Ministry</em></a>) and discussing how they apply in the 21st century. You might want to read my <a title="Spurgeon&rsquo;s Five Essential Ingredients In Every Preacher" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/spurgeons-five-essential-ingredients-of-every-sermon/">introduction</a> for more background.</p>
<p>[/box]</p>
<p>The first of these is Light.</p>
<p>By light, obviously Spurgeon meant <strong>knowledge</strong>. It&rsquo;s interesting to me that Spurgeon didn&rsquo;t put fire, or even faith, ahead of light. The very first thing a preacher needs, according to Him is light.</p>
<p>Basically he broke his talk about Light into five sub points which I've attempted to summarize with excerpts and comments below&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="preachersshouldbestudents">Preachers should be students</h2><br />

<p>Spurgeon said that preachers should be always learning. Never settling upon the knowledge they have, but always pushing forward to gain more. He advocated study, and even said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a great advantage to a minister to commence his public life in a small village, where he can have time and quiet for steady reading; that man is wise who avails himself of the golden opportunity.</blockquote><br />
Spurgeon held the attention of masses with the spoken word week in and week out for over twenty years. He repeated himself very little. He knew that any speaker who isn&rsquo;t always feeding his brain is very quickly going to run out of things to say.</p>
<h2 id="preachersshouldbestudentsofthewordofgod">Preachers should be students of the Word of God</h2><br />
While any education is helpful for a preacher&hellip;</p>
<blockquote><p>You are to be, above all things, students of the Word of God; this, indeed, is a main point of your avocation. If we do not study Scripture, and those books that will help us to understand theology, we are but wasting time while we pursue other researches.</blockquote><br />
Spurgeon compared preachers who spend all of their time studying other topics to medical students who study astronomy. There might be some link, but we are best to study the Word.</p>
<h2 id="preachersneedtogivelightouttotheircongregations.">Preachers need to give light out to their congregations.</h2><br />
This is my favorite part of this little essay. Spurgeon makes the point that knowledge is essential&hellip;</p>
<blockquote><p>Never fall into the notion that mere earnestness will suffice without knowledge, and that souls are to be saved simply by our being zealous. I fear that we are more deficient in heat than in light; but, at the same time, that kind of fire which has no light in it is of a very doubtful nature, and cometh not from above.</p>
<p>The preacher may preach with a great deal of stamping, and hammering, and crying, and entreating; but the Lord is not in the wind, nor in the fire;&mdash;the still small voice of truth is needed to enter the understanding, and thereby reach the heart.</blockquote></p>
<h2 id="preachersneedtovalueinstructionoverdelivery.">Preachers need to value instruction over delivery.</h2><br />

<blockquote><p>Brethren, we must not make it our aim to be grand orators. Certain men are eloquent by nature, and it is not possible for them to be otherwise than oratorical, any more than for nightingales to help singing sweetly; these I do not blame, but admire. It is not the duty of the nightingale to bring down its voice to the same tone as that of the sparrow. Let it sing sweetly if it can do so naturally. God deserves the best oratory, the best logic, the best metaphysics, the best of everything; but if ever rhetoric stands in the way of the instruction of the people, a curse on rhetoric!</blockquote></p>
<h2 id="preachersshouldrealizethataninstructedmemberisamemberwhowillstay.">Preachers should realize that an instructed member is a member who will stay.</h2></p>
<blockquote><p>Teach the people all truth, and let not our distinctive opinions be concealed. There are sheep-stealers about, who come forth in the night, and run away with our people because they do not know our principles,&mdash;the principles of Nonconformists, the principles of Baptists, or even the principles of Christianity&hellip; Keep the light of truth burning, and thieves will not dare to plunder your house.</blockquote></p>
<h2 id="personaltakeawaysandapplication.">Personal takeaways and application.</h2><br />
Many fundamentalists and independent Baptists have long tolerated a fire that gives off no light. We&rsquo;ve emphasized delivery, stories, and personality at the expense of the transfer of truth. I&rsquo;ve read a ton about Charles Haddon Spurgeon, and I&rsquo;ve never read that he was anything but a passionate, fiery, dynamic personality in the pulpit. Spurgeon realized, however, that none of those things were <strong>the</strong> essential, <strong>the</strong> essential was the passing on of truth.</p>
<p>Also, underlying what Spurgeon taught here is something that every aspiring preacher (or other public speaker) needs to take notice of:</p>
<blockquote><p>No one can speak well who has not prepared well, and you cannot prepare for a life of constant public speaking without being a voracious and lifelong student.</blockquote><br />
You don&rsquo;t keep people&rsquo;s attention in the long run by jumping on your head, telling funny stories, or through vocal gymnastics, <strong>you keep people&rsquo;s attention by saying something worth listening to</strong>. We have an unending source of something worth listening to in the Bible. Let&rsquo;s be better students of it.</p>
