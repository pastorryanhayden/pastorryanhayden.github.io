<p>This last week, there were two cases in the news with an alarming similarity: people were harassed and mistreated for holding views held by at least a quarter of all Americans; views which, in recent memory, were held by a vast majority. An Atlanta pastor,<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/01/10/louie-giglio-pulls-out-of-inaugural-over-anti-gay-comments/"> Louie Giglio</a> (famous for fighting against human trafficking), was disinvited from praying at President Obama's inauguration because he preached that homosexuality was a sin fifteen years ago. Also, University of Toledo employee, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/blog/university_of_toledo_official.php">Crystal Dixon</a>, an African American, was fired for writing a letter to the editor explaining why she didn't think it was fair to call homosexuality a civil rights issue. If you look for it, you'll see an increasing trend towards pushing people with traditional faith views out of active involvement in society. Two years ago, no president in history, including the current one, had ever voiced support for homosexual marriage. Today, if you speak up against homosexual marriage in some contexts, you might get fired, your business might be told it's not welcome on a college campus, or you might be labeled and marginalized out of public involvement in society. How did this happen? First, homosexuality has been labeled as a human right, and there has been a refusal to have any discussion about it. &nbsp;Second, anyone who voices public views against homosexuality, no matter how civilly, is labeled a hater and demonized. Third, the demoniacal haters are told they are not welcome at the table of public society. As a young pastor, I'm concerned about where this ends. I'm afraid the time is coming when I will either be told to change my message (and compromise my convictions) or to stop preaching. Are haters fit to hold office? To pastor a church? To run a school? To even raise their own children? As scary as that line of thought is, it's not too far a jump from what's happening to Louie Giglio or Crystal Dixon. I have an idea. Let's demand that tolerance goes in more than one direction. Let's demand fairness in the battle of ideas. Let's refuse to call people names and label those who do. And for those of us who still believe the Bible, let's refuse to be marginalized into an ever shrinking corner of American society.</p></p>
