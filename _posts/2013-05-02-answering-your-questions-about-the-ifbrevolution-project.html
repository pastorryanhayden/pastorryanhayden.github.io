<p>Since announcing the <a href="http://ifbrevolution.com">IFBrevolution project </a>the other day, several people have asked me questions about it. &nbsp;I thought it would be helpful if I took a post and answered those questions.</p>
<h2 id="whyareyoudoingthis">1. Why are you doing this?</h2><br />
The sole purpose of the IFBRevolution project is to raise awareness about three unbiblical practices that too often go completely unchecked within IFB churches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abuse of Scripture</li>
<li>Preacher Worship</li>
<li>Prideful Factionalism</li><br />
</ul><br />
These are not the ONLY problems within IFB churches, but they are in most cases foundational problems. For example, a commitment to a proper treatment of scripture will go a long way towards ironing out doctrinal problems. A commitment to avoiding preacher worship will eventually have a huge impact on abuse of pastoral power (where that exists). A rejection of factionalism will enable independent Baptist churches to truly be independent.</p>

<p>The vision for IFBRevolution is to be all about awareness. The goal is to force a Biblical conversation on these three issues across the spectrum of fundamentalism, to encourage pastors to take a stand where the Bible takes a stand, and to inform believers, through articles written by many pastors, about the dangers inherent in these three problems.</p>
<h2 id="areyoutryingtostartanothergroup">2. Are you trying to start another group?</h2><br />
Absolutely Not. I have no intentions whatsoever in starting another political circle within IFB churches. My goal in designing this was that it be &ldquo;circle independent.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not asking pastors to come together, I&rsquo;m asking pastors to take a stand, a specific stand, in whatever context they are in. There are no plans for any fellowship meeting, conferences, newspapers, etc. rising from this effort.</p>
<h2 id="areyougoingtonamenames">3. Are you going to &ldquo;name names&rdquo;?</h2><br />
On my personal blog, I never name names. That is not because I think naming names is an unbiblical practice, it is because I feel that the ideas I present have a better chance of being heard if people don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m attacking their favorite preacher. Naming names may be a beneficial practice, I just don&rsquo;t feel like my blog is the place for it.</p>
<p>I really want IFBrevolution to be more about our future than our past and present. I also want it to be something that appeals to a cross section of IFB churches from many different circles, for those reasons, I&rsquo;m going to institute a &ldquo;no name naming&rdquo; policy.</p>
<h2 id="areyougoingtodevolveintoafreeforallanti-fundamentalismsite">4. Are you going to devolve into a free for all anti-fundamentalism site?</h2><br />
I want IFBrevolution to be a focused project. For that reason, the only things you will find information about on the IFBrevolution website are our three issues and their corresponding positive virtues.</p>
<p>I also want it to be God honoring and encouraging. If and when comments are opened for articles, they will be tightly monitored so that the web site does not develop the critical and bitter tone that you find in other websites that are in any way critical of Independent Baptist churches.</p>
<h2 id="whatswiththepledge">5. What&rsquo;s with the pledge?</h2><br />
A major part of the plan for IFBrevolution is a pledge we are asking pastors to sign and publish. The words of the pledge are:</p>
<blockquote><p>I pledge to take a stand against those who would abuse the Bible by preaching it without regard to it&rsquo;s original context and those who neglect it by preaching only on topics. I will not do these things myself, and I will make this stand known to all who use my pulpit. I pledge to strive for humility in my leadership roles. I will deflect attention given me to my Lord Jesus Christ and will withhold admiration and applause from preachers who are actively seeking it. I pledge to be loyal to Christ, to His church, and to His Word. I will not base my loyalty on any one school, preacher, paper, or other man made institutions.</blockquote><br />
It is not a pledge of loyalty to our website or our writers, it is a pledge to take a stand. (A stand that I believe strongly the Bible mandates.) I totally understand pastor&rsquo;s being hesitant about signing pledges, but I think this is a worthy one.</p>
<h2 id="areyougoingtopolicethepledgers">6. Are you going to police the pledgers?</h2><br />
No. This isn&rsquo;t an organization that&rsquo;s trying to have any kind of oversight over anyone. I believe strongly in the independence of the church. This is merely a venue to encourage pastors to take a stand within their church on these three issues.</p>
<h2 id="willitbekjvonly">7. Will it be KJV only?</h2><br />
I adhere to the Received Text position of scriptural interpretation. (In practice, that makes me KJV only.) The writers and active participants of IFBrevolution will be people that share doctrinal and practical common ground with me and that will be a part of it. We will not, however, make being KJV only a part of our pledge, or ask those who are promoting the cause of IFBrevolution to adhere to any form of doctrinal statement.</p>
<p>The reason for that <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Isaiah1" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">is 1</a>) This is not an organization or fellowship of preachers, it is merely the promotion of a cause. 2) I really want this to be about a biblical cause, and I think even those who don&rsquo;t walk in lock step with me doctrinally can agree that these things are taught against in scripture. I want to give them the opportunity to publish that.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions or comments about the IFBrevolution project, please let me know in the comments. Also, please, please spread the word and consider helping.</p>
<p>God Bless.</p>
