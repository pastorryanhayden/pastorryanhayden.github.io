<p>I'm a very conservative guy - far more conservative about many things (music, dress, etc.) than many IFB preachers my age, but unlike many young conservatives, I've grown to despise the buzzword "old-paths." That's not to say that I despise the "old-paths." (If you were to visit my church, you'd find it remarkably similar to the same kind of church fifty years ago.) I just don't like the buzzword and refuse to use it. Let me tell you why:</p>
<h2>"Old-paths," like all buzzwords, is defined by its context.</h2><br />
Old-paths is a pretty nebulous term. It means different things to different people. If you are an extreme hacker type of preacher - old paths might refer to the liberty to &ldquo;rip face&rdquo; as you preach. It might refer to a certain style of preaching or music. Maybe it refers to a refusal to update the church furniture, carpet and decor or a refusal of anything like screens or well designed bulletins. No one, at least no one who has any real authority, is defining the term for all of us. So no one really knows what it means.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Old-paths&rdquo; too often means a blind acceptance of simplistic religion.</h2><br />
What "old-paths" seems to mean, at least in most of the uses I've seen, is the adherence to a small checklist of church "dos" and "don'ts." "Old-paths" and what I call "one-liner religion" seem to go hand in hand. The people who shout the most about "old-paths" seem to be people who have very little room for any gray areas and seem to think they've got it all worked out.<strong> It's a reductionist religion.</strong> Give me a short list of what works. (Forget the whole of scripture.) Call it "old-paths". Move on in full attainment of Christian perfection.</p>
<p>The only problem with this is that none of the checklists promoted as the "old-paths" are checklists found in scripture. Certainly, many of the things they harp about are scriptural, and need to be done, but no where in scripture does God say "here is my checklist for a good church" and then give us anything even close to the typical "old-paths." Like so many trends in IFB churches, it replaces the best thing (scripture) with a simplified list of good things and if overemphasized, potentially robs people of what the Bible actually says.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Old-paths&rdquo; often aren't that old.</h2><br />
Many of the people who like to shout about the old paths seem to think of the old paths as things like the bus ministry, 1960s style soulwinning methods, or a revivalistic topical preaching style (none of which I'm against.). Often, "the old-paths" would better be describes as "the mid-1900s paths." As many of the things that are considered old-paths today were considered innovations a generation or two ago. Also, many of the things that the "old-paths" crowd are reacting against (expository preaching, a rejection of a 1-2-3 pray with me soteriology, pastoral accountability, christian liberty, etc.) are a return to paths much older than those promoted by the "old-paths" crowd.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Old-paths&rdquo; are too often used as an excuse to bash young pastors.</h2><br />
I've read two articles this month, both trumpeting the "old paths" that were little more than an excuse to bully younger pastors. One (found in <em>Revival Fires!</em>) called us "a bunch of preppy Absoloms who know more about their palm pilots than the New Testament and couldn't write a sermon without a computer." Then went on to say many more unkind, untrue and uncharitable things about young pastors. The other (in <em>Old Paths Journal</em>) called young pastors "spiritual hippies" and "a generation of wimpy, pink tea and lemonade drinking, lace on their underwear, panty waisted, compromising misfits."</p>
<p><em><strong>How is any of that helpful?</strong></em></p>
<p>If young pastors are their intended audience (and what would be the purpose of the articles if not - to entertain an older crowd??) then surely their are better ways to make your point than broad brushing an entire generation of young men. I would like to remind these guys that despite the fact the national scandals and the ridiculous antics of many independent Baptists that give us a bad name, our generation are still preaching the Word under the IFB banner because we think it's the right thing to do.</p>
<p>So in short, if you like to hashtag all of your tweets with #oldpaths or choose to go on and on about "the old paths" in your sermons, I'm not going to break fellowship with you. You might be guilty of none of this. I just won't be joining the "old paths" party any time soon.</p>
