<p>Revival is a wonderful theme, and also quite dangerous.</p>
<p>Many misconceptions about the work of the Holy Spirit, the way that we live the Christian life, and the way ministry should be accomplished have snuck in under <strong>the trojan horse of revival</strong>.</p>
<p>For the next little while, I&rsquo;ll be writing (and preaching) about the dangers and blessings of revival.</p>
