<p>Recently, I read the article <a href="http://www.bobgraysr.com/2014/01/the-danger-of-being-too-close.html">"Too Close"</a> by Dr. Bob Gray of Longview, Texas. I'm not too familiar with Dr. Gray. All I know of him is that he has made a name for himself trying to be both a clone of Jack Hyles and the defender and definer of<a href="http://www.amazon.com/When-Principle-Was-King-Principles/dp/1602082863/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391661058&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=when+was+king+bob+gray"> Dr. Hyle's legacy</a>. I know that a few weeks ago, he made some ridiculous charges against Dr. Mark Rasmussen of West Coast Baptist and has not apologized for them. Beyond that, I know very little about him.</p>
<p>The article - Too close - makes the point that we shouldn't get too close to people - particularly leaders - that we should gloss over their weaknesses and failures. It supposedly makes this premise from the story of Noah's drunkenness and goes on to apply it to marriage, family and the church but especially to Christian leaders.</p>
<p>I think the article is a little too close to heresy, and serves as a sad example of how some have traded the message of the Bible for the movement of fundamentalism.</p>
<p>How can I say this is heresy? Well, the article ignores scripture, contradicts scriptures, and outright invents scripture.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I mean...</p>
<h2>The article ignores scripture.</h2><br />
In the middle of the article, Dr. Gray says</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me see the beautiful forests, but do not let me become too close to see the knots, broken branches, dead branches, serpents, insects, or the spiders.</blockquote><br />
That's a pretty good synopsis of the whole thing.</p>
<p>But is that scriptural? When it comes to telling the stories of people, does God just present the good, or does He present the bad as well.</p>
<p>We wouldn't know about Noah's drunkenness, about Moses' anger, about Elijah's despairing, about Abraham's lying, about Peter's vacillating, about John the Baptist's doubting, about John Mark's wimping, or about David's adulterating if God did not see fit to include it in His Word.</p>
<p>All scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable. Even the biographies that include peoples failures. Dr. Gray may like impressionism, but God paints in photorealistic clarity. Dr. Gray may want to airbrush, but God gives us the picture warts and all.</p>
<p>So why did God tell us these things? Maybe because He wants us to learn <em>"Therefore let no man glory in men."</em> (<a class="bibleserver extern" href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians3%3A21" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>.) Maybe because He wants us to know that the stories in the Bible are not stories of "great men" but stories of flawed men being used by a great God. Maybe it's supposed to be about Him, and not about men.</p>
<h2>The article contradicts scripture.</h2><br />
Not only does "too close" ignore the biographical scriptures but it makes claims that outright contradict scripture. Throughout the article, Dr. Gray warns us about getting "too close" to our wife, "too close" to our church and too close to our friends.</p>
<p>Consider this section:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are married to the love of your life and then you become too close to her. You have a new pastor and then you become too close to him. You have a friend and then you become too close to them.</blockquote><br />
And then consider this:</p>
<ul>
<li>God said that a man and his wife are no longer two, but one.</li>
<li>God said that a husband should dwell with his wife according to knowledge.</li>
<li>Jesus said a husband and wife should cleave to each other. That they are bone of bone and flesh of flesh.</li>
<li>God said that the church is a body and the members body parts.</li>
<li>God said that a church should have mutual care one for another, care that includes the confession of sin and the restoring of fallen brethren.</li>
<li>God said that there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Do you get my point. Maybe Dr. Gray didn't mean "don't get too close to your wife" or "don't get too close to your church," but if he didn't mean it, he shouldn't have said it. It contradicts scripture.</p>
<h2>The article invents scripture.</h2><br />
This is my biggest problem with the article. The major premise, that we shouldn't get "too close" to people is something that is nowhere TAUGHT in scripture. In fact, as we've already seen, scripture seems to teach the opposite of Dr. Gray's "too close" doctrine.</p>
<p>But what about Noah?</p>
<p>It's not as if at the end of every chapter in Genesis, or 2 Chronicles, or Acts there is a little break that says "and the moral of the story is." No, you have to read the moral into the story, and if you read a moral into a story that isn't backed up by the non-narrative parts of scripture, then you aren't preaching God's Word, you are preaching your opinion.</p>
<p>That's not Bible preaching. That's not exegesis (gleaning from the text) it's eisegesis (reading into the text.) A preacher could use that method and teach pretty much whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>If we are going to make conclusions based on stories from the Bible - What about Peter and Paul? Paul, don't get too close to Peter. Don't dwell on his faults. By all means, don't rebuke or expose Him publicly.</p>
<p>But that's not the story we see in scripture. I draw from that another application.</p>
<p>Maybe in the minds of Dr. Gray and folks like him the line between fundamentalist leaders of the mid-1900s and what the Bible actually says has gotten a little bit blurry. Maybe the problem is that Dr. Gray and folks like him have gotten "too close" to a movement and not close enough with the actual message of the Word.</p>
