<p>Many old school fundamentalist have a real problem with "end justifies the means" situation ethics. They take a look at the influence of the modern church growth movement and they criticize those who would do almost anything to get people in the door. They reject the idea that we have to use carnal music and methods to win the lost to Christ.</p>
<p>Those same old school fundamentalists will sometimes use a verse out of context, say things that are not really true about other religious groups, be hateful or rely on questionable or simplistic one liners. When pressed about this - they'll almost always use situation ethics and say that the end justifies the means.</p>
<p>I'm sure I'm not the only one that sees the irony in this.</p>
<p>A good end never justifies a bad means. (Or as Bob Jones Sr. used to say "It's never right to do wrong to do right.")</p>
<p>I'm against much of the church growth movement because I think it takes a feat of situational ethics gymnastics to justify it. But I refuse to give a pass to some "old fashioned" preacher who is also using situational ethics just because we have the same subtitle on our church sign or because we both disagree with what is going on.</p>
<p>That's my two cents for the night.</p>
