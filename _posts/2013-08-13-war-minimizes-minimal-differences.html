<p>Each of the various regions of our country produce people that are different. Yankees and southerners. Farmers and city slickers. White and black. I'm a yankee (and by that I mean I was raised in the Northeast) and I can testify as one who has lived both in the deep south and in the midwest that all three of those groups are wildly different. Even in a city like Knoxville, TN there is a huge cultural difference between the white and black population. It's almost like two cities.</p>
<p>I imagine, (and I've read) that when people from all of those wildly different groups were brought together into one army during World War 2, at some point they ceased to be yankees and southerners, democrats and republicans and became united in a battle for survival. At some point it ceased to be us (yankees) vs them (southerners) and became us (americans) vs them (Japanese.) The heat of battle minimizes minimal differences.</p>
<p>We are heading towards battle in America at breakneck speeds. In the not too distant future, there will no longer be any cultural capital to be gained by being a member of a Baptist church. All who believe the Bible will be seen as fringe groups, pariahs to society, enemies of the common good. Oxford University teachers are talking about treating real religion as a psychiatric disorder. The hard social left is making it more and more clear that there is no room at the table of public discourse for those whose decisions are made based on the Bible. If things keep going the way they are going, the landscape of Christianity in America is going to look vastly different than it does now.</p>
<p>I think the time is coming when the differences we squabble over are going to seem like the trite and ridiculous things that they are in the light of the war that we have on our hands. I think all of us are going to have to reexamine the walls we've put up, and the enemies we've made. Walls will come down, and it will be a good thing.</p>
<p>If that seems impossible, consider this: when the bombs start falling, the cultural, nominal Christians will run for the hills, and we'll know that those who are left standing are standing on the Word of God. Churches will get fewer and smaller, but oh will they be stronger.</p>
<p>I know there are sincere Bible believers in the denominations. (You do too.) I know there are sincere Bible believers who don't call themselves baptists. (You do too.) I know there are sincere believers who love God and His word who have come to very different conclusions in various areas of practice than I have. (Admit it, you do too.) I may not be quite ready to partner in ministry with these brothers yet, but I look forward to the day when the fires of opposition and persecution make it so I can.</p>
