<p><em>Last night I preached a message on "Dealing with the Gray Areas." &nbsp;I don't preach topical messages very often, but I thought this would be helpful and it was very well received. &nbsp;Below is the link to the sermon audio for the sermon, and underneath that, a blog post summary of what I preached.</em><br />

<p>Much of the application of scripture seems to be totally subjective. I mean, who gets to define words like &ldquo;modesty&rdquo; or &ldquo;sound words&rdquo; or &ldquo;sober minded&rdquo; for the twenty-first century? Because of this, you have people who want to look at anything not clearly laid out in scripture; things like dress, style, music, etc. and boldly declare that they have total liberty within that area because God&rsquo;s word doesn&rsquo;t touch on it specifically. They want to say &ldquo;Who cares if I&rsquo;m a gambling, smoking, skinny jeans wearing pin cushion with a green mohawk and a Pink Floyd t-shirt? Scripture says nothing about those things.&rdquo;<a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gray-areas.png"><br />

<p>Scripture might not settle every gray area in the Christian life, but it lays out a framework to do just that. Before deciding you have complete liberty in an area that scripture says little about directly, you should consider the following three things:</p>
<p><strong>Is my God given authority against it?</strong> God has set up authority in almost every area of our lives. In the church (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Hebrews13" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Hebrews 13</a>), in marriage (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Ephesians5" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Ephesians 5</a>), in government (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Romans13" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Romans 13</a>), in the home (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Ephesians6" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Ephesians 6</a>) and at work (<a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Ephesians6" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Ephesians 6</a>) God places people between us and what we want that would hurt either us or those around us. According to God, we don&rsquo;t know what is best for us, and God gives us authority figures to help us with that. So before you jump headlong into something that is a &ldquo;gray area&rdquo; you would be scripturally wise to check with your God given authority first.</p>
<p><strong>Will it cause divisiveness in the church?</strong> Paul spends all of <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians8" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 8</a> laying out why it&rsquo;s OK to eat meat that has been offered to idols, then concludes in verse 13 by saying if eating meat offends people in the church, he won&rsquo;t do it <em>&ldquo;while the world standeth.&rdquo;</em> God wants the church to be a place of unity. If your &ldquo;gray area&rdquo; decision is causing a big fuss in the church, then the charitable thing to do is just forego it.</p>
<p><strong>Will the elder generations of Christians have a problem with it?</strong> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Titus2" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Titus 2</a> and parts of 1 and 2 Timothy lay out a pattern for the church. Wisdom is to flow from the older generation to the younger generations. Unfortunately, much of what goes on in churches today is the fruit of plugging our ears to every opinion of the older generation. If some matter of personal style or preference is offensive to the godly older men or women of the church, then we can be assured that it is not of God.</p>
