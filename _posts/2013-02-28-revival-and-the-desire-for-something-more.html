<p>A couple of days ago, (My wife is having a baby any day now and that is taking priority over blogging right now.) I started a <a title="Do We Need A Revival?  Yes and No." href="http://ryan-hayden.com/do-we-need-a-revival-yes-and-no/">post series</a> about the dangers of emphasizing the wrong kind of revival. <strong>My point was that many people, in looking for revival, are looking for something totally foreign to New Testament Christianity.</strong> That&rsquo;s not to say revival can&rsquo;t happen in a local church or that it hasn&rsquo;t happened throughout Christian history. That&rsquo;s not to say Christians don&rsquo;t need true revival.</p>
<p><strong>Revival has been a trojan horse for all kinds of false doctrine.</strong> Things that would never fly in regular Bible teaching are justified by revival fire. Chief among the things that an unclear emphasis on revival brings into Baptist churches is Keswick or Higher Life teaching.</p>
<p>Wikipedia summarizes Keswick teaching like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The main idea of the Higher Life movement is that the Christian should move on from his initial conversion experience to also experience a second work of God in his life. This work of God is called &ldquo;entire sanctification,&rdquo; &ldquo;the second blessing,&rdquo; &ldquo;the second touch,&rdquo; &ldquo;being filled with the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; and various other terms. Higher Life teachers promoted the idea that Christians who had received this blessing from God could live a more holy, that is less sinful or even a sinless, life.</blockquote><br />
Revival <strong>as an emphasis</strong> is hard to find in history before the mid&ndash;1800s. Oh it&rsquo;s true that there were revivals before that time, but they didn&rsquo;t come about on purpose, and they weren&rsquo;t the result of a lot of talk on revival. The first person that really pushed the term revival was Charles Finney, who incidentally, also was really big on preaching &ldquo;a second blessing of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/charlesfinney.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-816" alt="charlesfinney" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/charlesfinney-244x300.jpg" width="244" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Today, most modern revivalists (at least Independent Baptist ones) don&rsquo;t go so far as to use that exact language, but there is still a strong undercurrent in a lot of talk about revival of achieving some heightened spiritual state that gives us power over sin.</p>
<p>But I haven&rsquo;t found that emphasis taught in the New Testament. And I&rsquo;ve looked.</p>
<p>Please understand me. I&rsquo;m not negating the work or importance of the Holy Spirit. I&rsquo;m not saying that Christians don&rsquo;t need the power of God through the filling of the Spirit to defeat sin or carry out the ministry effectively. What I am saying is that the second blessing of the Holy Spirit or <strong>any other post salvation crisis</strong> that is supposed to bring sanctification and power just isn&rsquo;t biblical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been cracking open the old theology books, brushing up on my pneumatology, and even reading some of John Owen&rsquo;s work on the Holy Spirit and I&rsquo;ve found it helpful. In contrast to what Baptists (and I think the Bible) have historically believed about the person and work of the Holy Spirit, this revival emphasis wants more:</p>
<h3 id="theywantmorethanprogressivesanctification.">They want more than progressive sanctification.</h3><br />
When the Bible talks about being &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; it is not talking about living in a continued state of some mystical experience. It is talking about Christian maturity that comes from Spirit led education, effort, and experience. It is the result of &ldquo;walking in the Spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;renewing our mind.&rdquo; It takes time for a plant to grow from seed to a sprout to a fruit bearing tree and it takes time for a Christian to become like Christ.</p>
<p>But people want more than that. They don&rsquo;t want to wait for the stew to braise, so they go looking for a pressure cooker.</p>
<p>There is a danger in treating revival like a second conversion. You know, you are saved then Spirit filled. You are converted then consecrated. According to the Bible, we got all of the Holy Spirit we were ever going to get when we were saved, we do not need a second experience of the Holy Spirit, we need to submit to the Holy Spirit we already have.</p>
<p>Every Christian is supposed to be giving their life to God. Every Christian is supposed to be living by the spirit. Every Christian is supposed to be consecrated. As Jesus said <em>&ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, that which is born of the spirit is spirit.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The idea that the revival service is some kind of fast forward where the Holy Spirit takes us from spiritual zero to spiritual hero is not found in the New Testament. This Christian life is a marathon, not a series of sprints.</p>
<h3 id="theywantmorethanscripturalunderstanding.">They want more than scriptural understanding.</h3><br />
When Jesus promised the coming of the Holy Spirit in John 16, He said that</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;He will guide you into all truth: for He shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: for he will shew you things to come.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
One of the things that is clear about the Holy Spirit in scripture is that one of the chief ministries of the Holy Spirit is guiding us into an understanding and obedience to the Scripture. (1 John 2:27)</p>
<p>The idea that some people seem to have, that you either emphasize the scripture or you emphasize the Spirit just doesn&rsquo;t pass muster. The Spirit emphasizes the scripture. The scripture is the work of the Spirit. They aren&rsquo;t competing.</p>
<p>One of the chief dangers of emphasizing the wrong kind of revival is that it gives the impression that some kind of &ldquo;spiritual activity&rdquo; is a replacement for scriptural understanding and living. The same Holy Spirit that gives us power over sin gave us 66 books of Scripture and then said that it was given that we may be <em>&ldquo;perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Holy Spirit isn&rsquo;t at war with Himself. Any form of revivalism that downplays the authoritative teaching of the scripture isn&rsquo;t really spiritual.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably be writing more about this later. Any thoughts? Am I off base? Examples? Let me know in the comments.</p>
