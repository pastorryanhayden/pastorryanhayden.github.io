<p><em>Warning: This post is a little bit punchier than my normal posts. I may have had some bad pizza or something. I'll go back to my normal irenic self tomorrow.</em></p>
<p><strong>I think there is a growing rift among committed independent Baptists.</strong> You can see it on social media. You can see it in preacher fellowships. You can see it in IFB newspapers. It's not an intentional rift. It's not, at least at this point, a very heated rift. But it is definitely there and it's definitely growing.</p>
<p>If you listen to one crowd - they'll say that this rift is all about <strong><em>standards</em></strong>. That there is a generation of preachers who have jettisoned everything their spiritual forefathers stood for and are pressing on into full fledged neo-evangelicalism. It seems to them "the IFB" is sacred, and anyone who criticizes any part of it (other than by calling IFB pastors to the left of them on any issue a bunch of liberals, neo-evangelicals, panty-waists, scorners or compromisers) is guilty of a form of sacrilege.</p>
<p><em>I wholeheartedly disagree that this is about standards.&nbsp;</em>There are people on both sides of this that have very high standards, and are still taking unpopular stands within Christianity. No, it's not about standards. The real conflict is deeper than that.</p>
<p>At the heart of this rift, in my opinion is the role and authority of scripture.</p>
<p>On the one hand you have a crowd that believes God's Word, as God intended it, is to be the primary, if not sole authority for faith and practice. They also believe that the accurate teaching and authoritative preaching of scripture is God's prescription for the church. To them, scripture trumps tradition. To them, every preacher, no matter how influential or when they lived is to be judged according to the scripture. To them, if a standard or tradition is not backed by the full weight of scripture, then it is wrong for them to impose it upon people as if it were.</p>
<p>On the other hand you have a group that pays lip service to God's Word. In fact, they would pay lip service to most everything in the above paragraph. Yet, in practice, they hold up certain experiences and traditions as being equal to the authority of scripture or even exceeding the authority of scripture and they see anyone who questions those experiences or traditions as being an enemy of the truth.</p>
<p><em>In other words, it's not a conflict between a bunch of spiritual hippies and the militant old guard.</em> There are plenty of older preachers on both sides of this conflict and almost everyone I'm referring to still goes to church three times a week, where's traditional dress to church, has high standards of modesty, music, etc.. It's not a conflict about <strong>age</strong> and it's not a conflict about <strong>standards</strong>. It's a conflict between biblicists and experiential traditionalists.</p>
<p>If you want to watch this in action - observe how each crowd acts when their toes get stepped on. One goes to scripture and tries to make a case for their own behavior (or sometimes an apology) while the other crowd goes into attack mode, starts quoting hallowed fundamentalist preachers and asking questions about how many people walked the aisle in their ideological opponent's church last sunday. In other words, when they are pressed with Bible - they run to experience. To them experience, it seems, trumps biblical fidelity.</p>
<p><strong>To that crowd I want to ask: What are you defending?</strong></p>
<p>Are you defending the truth?&nbsp;If that's the case - give us the truth. Open your Bible and use it, in context, to show us we are wrong. Show us that it's ok to take a verse out of context as long as people get saved. Show us that it's ok to put some preacher on a godlike pedestal as long as souls walked the aisle during their ministry. Open the Bible and show us where it's ok to treat preachers like dirt, hurling false accusations at them and giving them ridiculous labels just because they disagree with you on some secondary matter of interpretation (or digress from your favorite preacher in one area). Show us from scripture where its ok to go around acting like you are above all criticism.</p>
<p>But when you realize you are defending your experience - please be honest and brave enough to admit it.</p>
<p>If some former pastor or your Bible college president holds more authority to you than the Bible - say so. If suits and shouting mean more to you than scripture - say so. If defending your authority as the man of God takes precedence over God's authority in the Word of God - say so. If your experience in the Christian faith has been so awesome that you've arrived and can learn nothing more - say so.</p>
<p>Here's what I'm going to say. I appreciate tradition, I appreciate most of our fundamental Bible colleges, and I appreciate the pastors who God has used in days gone by. When I'm judging my own or other ministries - I take all of this into account. I realize, however, that God's Word is the ultimate decider and it's authority is on a whole other level than all of these.</p>
<p>So when you criticize some Bible believing fundamentalist pastor because you don't like the color of his socks or because he exposed your foolishness for what it is - you can cite tradition, you can cite your heroes and you can call them names. <em>But if they are bringing a biblical argument - you better counter with a biblical argument.</em> Anything less than that either shows you are defending something other than biblical Christianity or shows that you are contentious enough to go to war with a brother over something you don't have scripture to prove.</p>
