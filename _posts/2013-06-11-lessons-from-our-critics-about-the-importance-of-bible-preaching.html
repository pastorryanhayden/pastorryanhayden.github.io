<p><a title="A Rebuke to the Readers of Stuff Fundies Like" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/a-rebuke-to-the-readers-of-stuff-fundies-like/">I&rsquo;m no fan of Stuff Fundies Like</a>. That <a title="Reasons I Could Never Be Mainstream" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/reasons-i-could-never-be-mainline/">fact</a> is <a title="The &ldquo;Fundamental Flaws&rdquo; in Fundamental Flaws" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/the-fundamental-flaws-in-fundamental-flaws/">well documented</a>. But I&rsquo;m glad that they made this video because it so well illustrates the problem with so much non-biblical preaching. You should watch it till the end, it will take a minute and a half.</p>

<p>What I want to do in this post is give you two possible takeaways from this little video. But first, I need to give two disclaimers:</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer1">Disclaimer #1</h2><br />
I don&rsquo;t know John Hamblin personally. I (to my knowledge) have never heard him speak in person. Also, I did not hear the entire sermon, so this may have been taken out of context. (But I doubt it.) My entire knowledge of his ministry is limited to his ads in the Sword of the Lord and this video. So keep that in mind. This isn&rsquo;t an attack on John Hamblin. I&rsquo;m sure most of us independent Baptist pastors have at some point preached scripture out of context.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer2">Disclaimer #2</h2><br />
I am a teetotaler. I do not drink alcohol nor do not think it is wise for Christians to drink alcohol. There are dozens of negative references to alcoholic beverages and drunkenness in the scripture. Please don&rsquo;t take this article as a criticism of abstaining from alcohol or preaching on abstaining from alcohol. I just think that it (like all subjects) should be done in a way that is fair to the text of scripture.</p>

<h2 id="takeaway1">Takeaway #1</h2><br />
<strong>It is a dangerous thing to twist the scriptures.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/2Peter1%3A20-21" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">2 Peter 1:20&ndash;21</a> says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. 21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
<strong>It&rsquo;s dangerous because it&rsquo;s rude to God.</strong> God&rsquo;s word&rsquo;s were not spoken in a vacuum. They have a context. A grammatical context. A historical context. The context of the human penman of the book. Just as you and I would justifiably take offense when someone rips our words out of context and uses that to lend authority to their argument, I don&rsquo;t think that God is pleased when we wrest His Word from it&rsquo;s context to prove our point.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s dangerous because it opens people up to our fallible ideas.</strong> When we preach God&rsquo;s Word out of context, what we are really doing is preaching OUR word as if it has God&rsquo;s authority. This gives us almost unlimited ability to abuse and manipulate people from the pulpit.</p>
<h2 id="takeaway2">Takeaway #2</h2><br />
<strong>Preaching styles that elevate emotion over reason are inherently dangerous.</strong></p>
<p>One of the things I noticed about the message above was the way the audience was reacting with amens and the style of preaching almost left them with no choice but to accept what He was saying. When, when we put emphasis on emotional style and delivery of a sermon over and above the sermon&rsquo;s content, we are removing an important gatekeeper.</p>
<p>The Berean&rsquo;s were commended in Acts because they didn&rsquo;t just accept Paul&rsquo;s words, but searched the scripture to see if it was so. That tells me (and Paul&rsquo;s letters back it up) that Paul&rsquo;s preaching was primarily aimed at people&rsquo;s heads and that it&rsquo;s the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s job to move the teaching from the head to the heart.</p>
<p>To sum it all up, both of these problems: preaching that tries to rile people up by yelling and shouting, and preaching that relies on non-contextual proof texts <strong>are shortcuts</strong>. They are both dangerous shortcuts because they move the authority from God&rsquo;s perfect Word to the imperfect opinions of a preacher.</p>
<p>One more thought: When we rely too much on shortcuts, sooner or later people will figure that out, and it will throw into question our credibility as preachers.</p>
<p>Preach the Word.</p>
