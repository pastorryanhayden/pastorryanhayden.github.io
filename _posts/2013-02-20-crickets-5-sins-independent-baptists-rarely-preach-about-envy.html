<p>James 3 is one of my favorite passages in all of scripture. Yesterday, I explained how I think that James 3 is aimed primarily at preachers, and talked about one of the concluding sins of James 3 - Strife.</p>
<p>Just for a recap, here is the passage I&rsquo;m talking about:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. 14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. 16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. 17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.&rdquo;</em> (Emphasis added)</blockquote></p>

<a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/envy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-707" alt="envy" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/envy.jpg" width="600" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>I think a key phrase to that passage is verse 14 where it talks about bitter envying and strife being a sure sign that you don&rsquo;t have Godly wisdom (and don&rsquo;t need to be preaching.) We hit strife yesterday, so today, let&rsquo;s talk about <strong>envy</strong>.</p>
<p>The word envy refers to bitter and jealous rivalry. It is the attitude that refuses to rejoice in the accomplishment of our peers. That looks at other preachers is an &ldquo;us&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;them&rdquo; way.</p>
<h2 id="envyandstrifeareapreacherstemptations.">Envy and strife are a preacher&rsquo;s temptations.</h2><br />
In the New Testament, envy is almost always mentioned in connection with preachers and almost always with strife. Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:&rdquo;</em> (Philippians 1:15)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; 4 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, 5 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.&rdquo;</em> (1 Timothy 6:2)</blockquote></p>
<h3>IFB Pastors have struggled with envy.</h3><br />
Yesterday, Paul Chappell wrote a post about <a href="http://ministry127.com/pastoral-leadership/humility-in-baptist-churches">&ldquo;Humility in Baptist Churches&rdquo;</a> (It&rsquo;s an excellent article, and <em>in many ways proves this post series wrong</em>, which is a good thing.) In that article, Pastor Chappell had this to say under <strong>Pride in Numbers</strong>&hellip;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When people are saved through our ministry, God is glorified. That is the greatest privilege of ministry. But if we instead competed with other ministries to be the biggest, greatest, fastest growing, or any other superlative, we would cut ourselves off from God&rsquo;s grace.&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
He was (if I read the article right) referencing the spirit of Independent Baptist churches in the last forty years, and it&rsquo;s interesting to note that an element of that spirit was <em>competitiveness</em>.</p>
<p>Competitiveness&hellip;envy&hellip;ego&hellip;discontent.</p>
<h2 id="apersonalexample.">A personal example.</h2><br />
<a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-18-at-5.42.41-PM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-705 alignright" alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-18 at 5.42.41 PM" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-18-at-5.42.41-PM-300x262.png" width="300" height="262" /></a>Shortly after I moved to Mattoon to pastor our church, the independent Baptist church across town called a new pastor. I&rsquo;m 29, he&rsquo;s in his mid-forties. I&rsquo;ve never pastored before, he successfully pastored the same church for twenty years. No one knows who I am, he was an evangelist and college president before moving to our little town. It didn&rsquo;t take him long to start doing some of the things in Mattoon (start a businessman&rsquo;s Bible study, radio show, etc.) that I had hoped to do and for his church to start growing.</p>
<p>The temptation in that situation is to look at him, get jealous of his ministry, find some nitpicky difference between his church and ours to criticize, and to compete with him to be the biggest church independent Baptist church in town. The temptation is to envy. (Notice it comes from ego.) By God&rsquo;s grace, Dan Haifley is one of my best friends and we spend time together every week encouraging each other.</p>
<p>We are not competitors, we are co-laborers.</p>
<h2 id="thisisnotavictimlesscrime:">This is not a victimless crime:</h2><br />
Consider what these passages teach us about the consequences of envy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Envy and strife are a sure sign of a carnal church. (1 Cor. 3:3)</li>
<li>Envy and strife are a sure sign of a fleshly preacher. (James 3:15)</li>
<li>Envy and strife are a sign of bad doctrine (1 Tim. 6:2)</li>
<li>Envy and strife will cause other preachers problems (Philippians 1:15&ndash;16)</li>
<li>Envy and strife will bring <em>&ldquo;confusion and every evil work&rdquo;</em> into the church. (James 3:16)</li><br />
</ul><br />
Competitiveness in the ministry is nothing to be winked at. Envy is not some obscure sin. It was a problem for preachers in the 1st century and it&rsquo;s a problem for preachers in the 21st century. God&rsquo;s Word has a lot to say about it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s emphasize what scripture emphasizes.</p>
