<p>This morning, I was reading <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/01/24/women-in-combat-panetta/1863067/">an opinion article</a> in USA Today about the unexpected announcement that female soldiers would be allowed on the front lines of combat. Predictably, the USA today columnist (I couldn't find a name) spent her 600 words singing the praises of the decision with generous helpings of "fairness" and "equality" with an "overdue" thrown in as a garnish. All of that is well and good and a liberal feminist columnist certainly has the right to express whatever opinions she wants to. (If I were a feminist, I'd think a little editorial victory dance was more than appropriate given yesterday's unexpected news.) What I took issue with was the columns conclusion. After describing the arguments of the decisions critics, the columnist said:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Couched in slightly different terms, the same sort of arguments were raised when the military was racially integrated, and more recently when gays were allowed to serve openly."</p></p>
<p>"None of these dire predictions materialized."</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>It seems to me, that more and more, we are hearing this argument <a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/why-phil-snyder-is-wrong-about-gay-rights/">trotted out</a> to support any kind of social change. It's the old, "They used the same kind of arguments against black people" dodge, and it's being used all the time whether it's to silence the critics of gay marriage legislation or to silence the critics of some sort of feminism. Almost every liberal cause is being equated to the civil rights movement and the conservative detractors of those causes are subtly (or not that subtly) being equated with racists.</p></p>

<p>Here's the thing though, the "they said that about black people" dodge stinks. It is a classic false analogy. It is very, very sloppy logic. It's like saying "Adolf Hitler commissioned the Volkswagon, so Volkswagons are bad."</p></p>
<p>So why is it becoming so popular? Because it is effective. No one (at least no one I would want to hang out with) wants to be tied, in any way, to racial bigotry. The mere insinuation of this is powerful enough too silence many people and scare off many more possible followers.</p></p>
<p>On top of the fact that it is just sloppy logic, let me give you three reasons I particularly despise the "this is just what they did to the black people" line of reasoning.</p></p>
<h2>First, I didn't say that about black people and neither did my ancestors.</h2></p>
<p>I am a 29 year old from New Hampshire. That means that I was born a long time after the civil rights wars, and I was raised in an area where anybody who espoused racist ideas would be instantly discredited. On top of that, there were interracial marriages in both my family and my church from as long as I can remember. In college, I worked for the Boys and Girls Club in downtown Knoxville in a situation, where among 60 students and 6 staff members, I was usually the only white guy.</p></p>
<p>I hate racism and preach against it as often as there is even a hint of it in a biblical text (which is quite often.) When I was a teacher in Tennessee, the only real battle I faced came after I corrected some high school students over their use of racist language. So when a writer or politician hints that I am similar to a racist, I gag.</p></p>
<p>Not only have I never been a racist, but to my knowledge, neither were my ancestors. I come from long lines of New England people on one side and fairly recent Scots-Irish immigrants on the other. Neither of these groups had the slightest thing to do with racism, and to be frank, I'm growing sick of society making the assumption that because my skin is white I should have to pay some penance for what a bunch of southern people did 150 or even 50 years ago.</p></p>
<h2>Second, I despise the whole "they did that to black people" dodge because it assumes that all discrimination is evil, when it is not.</h2></p>
<p>We discriminate as a society all the time. When we we tell certain people they can't be doctors because their grades are too poor, we are discriminating. When we tell 12 year olds they are too young to be married, we are discriminating. Yes, it's discrimination to say a woman can't be a Navy Seal, but is that necessarily a bad thing? The difference between discrimination based on race and discrimination based on gender, age, or IQ is that race has absolutely no bearing on a person's potential to do a job, whereas age, gender, and IQ do. Yes, people argued for discriminating against black people, and they were wrong; but that doesn't, by any means, mean it's always morally wrong to discriminate.</p></p>
<h2>Third, I despise the whole "they did that to black people" dodge because it is a dodge, and it's almost always used to avoid a serious and civil discussion.</h2></p>
<p>There is a serious discussion to be had over the morality of putting woman on the front lines of combat. (Don't we have a moral duty to protect women?) and the propriety of it. But rather than have those discussions, a columnist can just say "well, we've heard this before, they said the same things about black people" and close the book.</p></p>
<p>Do you think I'm off base, or have your own examples to share, let me know in the comments.</p></p>
