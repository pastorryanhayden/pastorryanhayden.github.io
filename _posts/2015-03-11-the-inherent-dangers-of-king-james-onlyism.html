<p>I am a King James Only guy (to be technically accurate, I am a Textus Receptus guy.) I&rsquo;ve heard (and read) the arguments on both sides of the issue and I&rsquo;ve come down on the side of King James Onlyism. There are several reasons for that, but the main one is that I have a hard time believing that for millennia Christians had an incomplete Bible and that it took the work of theological liberals working in the last hours of the 1800s to fix that problem. (For similar reasons, I reject &ldquo;ruckmanism&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s variants - I have a hard time believing that it took the work of theological moonbats working in the last hours of the 1900s to give us a proper doctrine of bibliology.)</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t a post about why I only use the King James version in the pulpit. I imagine that most of the regular readers of this blog have a similar position.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this, because, more and more I see two real dangers come up as side effects of the King James Only position. These dangers are, in my opinion, just as ominous as the effects of using new Bible versions. Here they are:</p>
<h3>Danger 1: Tunnel Vision</h3><br />
When I read the book of 1 Corinthians (for example), I have to constantly remind myself that it isn&rsquo;t really a book - it is a letter. It is a letter written by one guy (Paul, writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit) to one church - a particularly messed up church in the city of Corinth. I also try to remind myself that it wasn&rsquo;t written in chapters and verses - it was written in paragraphs and that it wasn&rsquo;t written in 17th century English - it was written in Koine Greek. I remind myself of this because it&rsquo;s important that the meaning of a verse can&rsquo;t be separated from the meaning of the sentence it&rsquo;s in (many verses are sentence fragments), it can&rsquo;t be separated from the meaning of the paragraph, and it has to make sense in the meaning of the letter.</p>
<p>In other words, I&rsquo;m not trying to establish &ldquo;what does it mean it me&rdquo; - I&rsquo;m trying to establish &ldquo;what does it mean&rdquo; and come to &ldquo;what does it mean to me&rdquo; later on in the process. This is, in my mind, the essence of &ldquo;rightly dividing the Word of truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Because of the ironic mix of familiarity with the King James Version and unfamiliarity with some 17th Century English, I think those of us committed to using &ldquo;the old sword&rdquo; have to work harder at seeing Bible passages in context then those who use newer versions.</strong> Because people are unfamiliar with the language patterns - they tend to zero in on the parts they think they do understand and because they are so familiar with the King James over time, they aren&rsquo;t reading a letter, they are reading a collection of verses that&nbsp;get separated by a bunch of meaningless filler.</p>
<p>Because I used 1 Corinthians earlier, I&rsquo;ll give two examples from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve heard sermons on the text <em>&ldquo;Quit you like men&rdquo;</em> from 1 Corinthians 16:13 on how we should not quit. But that&rsquo;s not what that verse means at all. The words &ldquo;quit you&rdquo; are an archaic way to say &ldquo;be brave.&rdquo; But both familiarity and unfamiliarity make it mean something totally different to many people and it takes on a meaning completely foreign to what Paul intended.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve also heard whole sermons on how <em>&ldquo;knowledge puffeth up&rdquo;</em> (from 1 Corinthians 8:1) as an excuse to go on a rant against people who insist on - well - thinking through things. (Interestingly, I&rsquo;ve never heard someone jump on the phrases in 1 Corinthians 10:1 or 12:1 where Paul says &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have you ignorant.&rdquo;) I digress. In context, Paul wasn&rsquo;t slamming intellectuals in the church at Corinth - he was dealing with a cavalier attitude towards &ldquo;meat offered to idols&rdquo; that weighted their logic over the consequences on their fellow brothers in Christ. Paul wasn&rsquo;t saying &ldquo;stop thinking deeply about stuff&rdquo; - He was saying &ldquo;start thinking more about the guy on the other end of the pew. But again, for some people, that mix of unfamiliarity with older English and familiarity with a wrong reading of the text makes that understanding very hard to come by.</li><br />
</ul><br />
That&rsquo;s just two examples - you could probably find examples from every book of the Bible. Probably a quarter of the posts I&rsquo;ve written on here (on things like landmarks, old paths, etc.) go back to this same thing.This isn&rsquo;t the fault of the person in the pew - it&rsquo;s the fault of the person in the pulpit. If we as preachers insist on using the King James Version (as I do) and expect that our people do too - then it falls on us to help people past this unfamiliarity/familiarity mix. We help them with unfamiliarity by explaining the meaning of words that have come to mean other things and we help them with familiarity by constantly going back to context.If we don&rsquo;t do this - more and more we&rsquo;ll have a bunch of Christians who don&rsquo;t have a Bible - they have an anthology of isolated misinterpretations.</p>
<h3>Danger 2: Spiritual Elitism</h3><br />
The second danger of King James Onlyism is the danger of looking down on the majority of Christians who aren&rsquo;t King James only as if they are some lesser tier of believers or not believers at all.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the biggest thing a King James only position does for some churches is act as a wall. It keeps their people in - because they wouldn&rsquo;t touch the non-KJVo people with a ten foot pole - and it keeps broader evangelicalism out.<strong> It is the great insulator and isolator.</strong></p>
<p>This insulation and isolation does a couple of negative things: First, it creates a strong subculture where oddness is magnified and eventually codified. Just like the isolation of Japan created a culture so unique that, when it was finally found by westerners, seemed like a different world. Our isolation can foster unorthodox views and practices that, unchecked by the greater evangelicalism, make our church seem like another world. In other words - isolation can keep bad out - that&rsquo;s a good thing, but it can also keep bad in and allow bad to remain unchallenged - that&rsquo;s a bad thing.</p>
<p>The second thing isolation and insulation does is it gives churches an Elijah complex. They begin to think &ldquo;we are the only ones still using the pure word of God&rdquo; and from there it&rsquo;s only a short jump to &ldquo;we are the only real Christians.&rdquo; From the castle of King James Onlyism they look down on everyone else, and then begin to throw bombs. It serves as both a feather in the cap and ammunition in the gun.</p>
<p>But that attitude is wrong for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It assumes that people who don&rsquo;t use the King James aren&rsquo;t committed Christians. Go to your local home school group meeting and this will be forever disproved.</li>
<li>It fails to take into account people&rsquo;s context. Many more people come to Christ outside of King James onlyism than inside. Most of us wouldn&rsquo;t be at the position we are at was it not for providential intervention.</li>
<li>The Bible, in context, doesn&rsquo;t teach King James onlyism. It&rsquo;s something that, while important, has to be brought to the Bible.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s anglo-centric. It doesn&rsquo;t properly account for many Christians in non-english speaking countries.</li>
<li>Etc.</li><br />
</ul><br />
When it comes down to it - spiritual elitism based on King James onlyism or anything else is just pride and like all other pride it both stinks and causes unnecessary division.</p>
<p>(To be fair, this isn&rsquo;t a problem unique to the King James only crowd - plenty of non-KJVo folks treat us like a bunch of knuckle dragging neanderthals or assume that we are small minded legalists.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Here's what it comes down to: we who hold to any type King James only position must work extra hard on these two areas or else we&rsquo;ll end up with churches full of people looking down their noses at the rest of the world and pounding the covers of their King James Bibles all the while they&rsquo;ll know less and less of what it actually says.</p>
<p>If you want to leave comments - have at it. &nbsp;Just know I'm not in the least bit interested in debating King James Onlyism.</p>
