<p>Ever wonder how to evaluate spiritual leaders? I mean, we live in a day and age when there is so many opinions coming from so many different angles and sources that it's baffling. There are preachers from every stripe boldly proclaiming different messages, each emphasizing different things. You can take almost any issue of biblical importance and you'll find people with loud and bold opinions on either side of it, boldly proclaiming their position. Now, with the advent of social media, they all have platforms. How do you make heads or tails of it?</p>
<p>We are commanded to <em>"try the spirits, whether they are of God."</em> (1 John 4:1) But how do you do that? Beyond the obvious searching the scriptures to see if there message is biblical (like the Bereans were commended for doing with Paul) what do you do?</p>
<p>Hear is some of the advice I hear:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Look at the numbers.</strong> If the message comes from a "successful" pastor, give it more credence. (O.k. Joel Osteen get's props over Noah and Jeremiah - got it.)</li>
<li><strong>Look at the age.</strong> If the message comes from someone with gray hair, give it precedence over young people. (O.k. Eli takes precedence over Samuel, Saul gets props over David.)</li>
<li><strong>Look at the direction.</strong> If someone seems to be moving to the left, give them less weight than someone moving to the right. (O.k. So the pharisees get more weight than Jesus.)</li><br />
</ul><br />
Bearing in mind the obvious (and comical caveats), all of that is actually pretty decent general advice - but it isn't biblical advice. There is no passage of scripture that says "weigh the numbers, count the grays and check the direction."</p>
<p>So does the Bible cover this at all? Actually it does.</p>
<p>James 3:12 says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Who is wise and endued with knowledge among you?"</em></blockquote><br />
It's a rhetorical question. The book of James actually gives us a way to answer it. It gives us a checklist with which to "try the spirits" of spiritual leaders. Interestingly, it doesn't say a thing about chairs or gray hairs. Here is what it does say:</p>
<h2>1. Do they have an obviously good lifestyle?</h2></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"...let him shew out of a good conversation his works..."</em></blockquote><br />
If they are saying they God's messenger, and yet they living in open sin and are not <em>"above reproach,"</em> then we should just move along.</p>
<h2>2. Are they teachable?</h2></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"...with meekness of wisdom..."</em></blockquote><br />
If a supposed spiritual leader has intellectually arrived to the point where they cannot learn from others, they probably aren't someone who is <em>"wise and endued with knowledge among you."</em></p>
<h2>3. Are they without envy?</h2></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"...but if ye have bitter <strong>envying</strong> and strife in your heart..."</em></p>
<p><em>"..."for where <strong>envying</strong> and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work...</em></blockquote><br />
Are they motivated by envy? Are they trying to be bigger/richer/more respected than ??????? Are they motivated by competition?</p>
<p>If they are, then it's a safe bet they do not have spiritual wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<h2>4. Are they without strife?</h2></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"...but if ye have bitter envying and <strong>strife</strong> in your heart..."</em></p>
<p><em>"..."for where envying and <strong>strife</strong> is, there is confusion and every evil work...</em></blockquote><br />
The word <em>"strife"</em> here is an interesting word. It's political. It speaks of someone trying to put himself into office by putting others down. In modern parlance, it's a person running attack ads and smear campaigns.</p>
<p>If a person claims to have spiritual wisdom and be a spiritual leader, and yet he is building himself up by character assassination, he isn't. As much as possible, wise men win arguments on the strength or weakness of ideas, not by attacking their opponents character or experience.</p>
<h2>5. Are they pure?</h2></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"...But the wisdom that is from above is first pure..."</em></blockquote><br />
The word "pure" here is the same word our KJV translators rendered "truly, certainly, and indeed." I think it is talking purity and singleness of mind. Spiritually wise people are not "double minded."</p>
<h2>6. Are they peaceable?</h2></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"...then peaceable..."</em></blockquote><br />
Jesus said <em>"blessed are the peacemakers."</em> Paul said <em>"If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men."</em> and the writer of Hebrews said <em>"Follow peace with all men."</em> People with spiritual wisdom are not people who are always looking for a fight. When they do have to fight, they are trying to "conquer their foes and turn them into friends."</p>
<h2>7. Are they gentle?</h2></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"...gentle..."</em></blockquote><br />
A gentle person is conscious and caring about the feelings of others. They do not run roughshod. They speak the truth, but they do it in love. They never resort to a rhetorical atom bomb, when a scalpel would do.</p>
<h2>8. Are they approachable?</h2></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"...and easy to be entreated..."</em></blockquote><br />
Someone once said that the way to tell if someone has a servants heart is to treat them like a servant and see how they respond. A spiritually wise person is not going to be above question, nor is he going to be above taking orders from others.</p>
<h2>9. Are they merciful?</h2></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"...full of mercy..."</em></blockquote><br />
One of the attributes of God that we are most thankful for is His mercy. All of us know that if it were not for God's mercy, we would still be in our sins and we would be heading for eternal judgment in hell.</p>
<p>A merciful Christian leader looks at others and thinks "They are just being beaten by the same enemy that often beats me." They might get mad at the disease. They might get mad at the symptoms. But they are able to have pity on the victims because they are aware that they themselves are often losing the battle to sin.</p>
<h2>10. Are they full of good fruits?</h2></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"...and good fruits..."</em></blockquote><br />
This could be talking about fruits of evangelism, but more likely, given the context of spirituality, this is talking about fruits of the spirit. Does a spiritual leader have <em>"love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance?"</em></p>
<h2>11. Are they without bias?</h2></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"...without partiality..."</em></blockquote><br />
<em>"Without partiality"</em> is a phrase found only in this verse - no where else in the Bible. So I had to look it up. "Partiality" is defined (in Webster's 1828) as "is an inclination to favor one side or party of a thing over another." Another word for it is bias.</p>
<p>Bias, or partiality is a powerful force, and it always has a blinding effect. It was partiality that allowed generations of american and british Christians to justify slavery and racism. Politically, it baffles us that our opponents can blindly accept every line coming from their party, but we don't even realize that we do the same thing - that's partiality.</p>
<p>Spiritual wisdom recognizes that we all have bias, we all have blind spots, and tries to compensate. It withholds judgment until it has all the facts. It doesn't assume.</p>
<h2>12. Are they without hypocrisy?</h2></p>
<blockquote><p><em>"...without hypocrisy..."</em></blockquote><br />
Does a spiritual leader wear two faces? Are they one way at home and another in the church? Are they pretenders? If they are, they probably don't have spiritual wisdom.</p>
<p>The list ends with a definitive statement most of us have forgotten is in the Bible. It says...</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace."</em></blockquote><br />
This isn't my list - it's God's list. I didn't make it up, I just shared it with you. If you don't like it or think I'm taking things out of context - please take the time to read it over and over in the context of the whole chapter and book, and then take the time to study it in detail.</p>
<p>If you do, I think you'll find as I've found that this is an amazingly powerful tool for <em>"trying the spirits, whether they are of God."</em></p>
<p><strong>Personally, there are entire theological movements I've avoided - not out of study - but because I cannot find a single representative of their ideas who even comes close to fitting in this list.</strong></p>
