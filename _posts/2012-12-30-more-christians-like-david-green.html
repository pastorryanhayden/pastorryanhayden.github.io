<div><em>I'm planning on submitting this to the local paper for my turn at their weekly Clergy Voice feature. &nbsp;But seeing it's timely, I didn't think there was any hurt in posting it here early.</em></div></p>
<div>David Green doesn't just hold his beliefs, he acts on them. &nbsp;As founder and and owner of Hobby Lobby Stores, he has consistently put his money where his beliefs are. &nbsp;David Green recently purchased a historically significant college campus in Massachusetts to give away to a seminary. &nbsp;He has invested heavily in securing artifacts for a museum on Bible translation and has announced his plans to build that museum in D.C. somewhere near the Smithsonian. &nbsp;He has paid to print and distribute more than a billion copies of the Bible. &nbsp;In a decision that has probably cost Hobby Lobby millions, Green closes every store every Sunday, so that his employees can be free to worship and have a day set aside to spend with their families. &nbsp;Unlike most national retail chains, Hobby Lobby emphasizes taking care of it's employees and no one who works there makes minimum wage.</div></p>
<div>Recently, rather than compromise his convictions about what he sees as abortion, David Green has made the decision to pay hefty fines to the federal government (over one million a day) as a consequence for not providing the morning after or week after pills to his employees mandated by the Health Care laws. &nbsp;Regardless of your position on Obamacare, you have to admire a man whose belief translates into more than bumper stickers, a man who is willing to lose his life's work and his fortune rather than disobey his God.</div></p>
<div>We need more Christians in this world like David Green. &nbsp; Before you misinterpret that statement, I'm not saying we need more billionaire philanthropists willing to invest heavily in the cause of Christ. (Although I wouldn't mind having one in our church.) &nbsp;What I am saying is that we need Christians who believe enough in the Bible to act on it, even at great cost to themselves.</div></p>
<div>Like a seed dropped in the middle of a concrete lot that somehow blossomed into strong and fruitful tree, &nbsp;Christianity rose to it's current status as the world's most popular religion even though it was started in the most hostile environment possible and its first adherents were simple, unlearned fishermen from the middle of nowhere. &nbsp;The reason for that, other than the blessing of God, was those simple unlearned fisherman (and several generations of Christians after them) believed something enough to give their life to it, and their life for it.</div></p>
<div>Now, 2000 years later, most churches are struggling to get their members to contribute **anything** or do more than attend one service a week faithfully. &nbsp;We complain about the waning influence of Christianity in our country and in our community, and yet, it doesn't influence our lives enough to move us from the lazyboy to the church pew on Sunday Morning. &nbsp;Maybe, just maybe, if our churches were full of people who believed like David Green, we would be making a bigger difference</div></p>
