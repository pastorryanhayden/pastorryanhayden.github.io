<p>If you are going to use PowerPoint in church, you should probably read these books:</p>
<p>This week I&rsquo;ve been writing about PowerPoint in church. Trying to share with you everything I know about the subject. Here is a recap:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="How To Use PowerPoint In Church" href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/how-to-use-powerpoint-in-church/">Intro and Uses for PowerPoint in Church</a></li>
<li><a title="How to make church more boring with PowerPoint" href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/how-to-make-church-more-boring-with-powerpoint/">How to Be Awful at PowerPoint and Bore Your Church to Tears</a></li>
<li><a title="Beyond the Projector: Three Other Ways To Use PowerPoint for Church" href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/beyond-the-projector-three-other-ways-to-use-powerpoint-for-church/">Beyond the Projector: Three Alternative Uses for PowerPoint</a></li><br />
</ul><br />
Today, I want to give you a list of books that you should read if you want to use PowerPoint in church and you want to do it well. I&rsquo;ve read many more books on the subject than this, these are just the absolute best. I&rsquo;m going to give them to you in the order I would recommend them, so if you only buy one book, buy the one on top.</p>
<h3>1. <a title="slideology amazon link" href="http://www.amazon.com/slide-ology-Science-Creating-Presentations/dp/0596522347/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406813754&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=slideology"><em>Slide:ology</em> by Nancy Duarte</a></h3><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/slideology.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1945" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/slideology.jpg" alt="slideology" width="260" height="261" /></a></p>
<p>Slide:ology is the single best book on using presentation software well that as ever been written. If I could only have one book on the subject, it would be this one without hesitation.</p>
<p>Nancy Duarte is principle of Duarte Design, a design firm that specializes in PowerPoint Presentations. One of their presentations even won a Nobel Peace Prize. (How many people can say that?) There is probably no one on the planet that know more about doing presentations right than Nancy Duarte and her team, and it shows in this book.</p>
<p>The book covers the purpose of presentations, different elements of each presentation, best practices and even serves as a good primer on graphic design. If you want to do better at PowerPoint, this is a book you should definitely own.</p>
<h3>2. <a title="Unfolding the Napkin Amazon link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Unfolding-Napkin-Hands-On-Problems-Pictures/dp/1591843197/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406813802&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><em>Unfolding the Napkin</em> by Dan Roam</a></h3><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/unfolding-the-napkin.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1946 size-full" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/unfolding-the-napkin.jpg" alt="unfolding the napkin by dan roam" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Dan Roam is an expert on communicating through visuals. He&rsquo;s written at least four books on the subject, and all of them are great, but in my opinion, the best is the second: <em>Unfolding the Napkin</em>. This book has one purpose - to teach you to think and communicate in pictures. It&rsquo;s aimed at businessmen, but I think it&rsquo;s a great resource for anyone who teaches.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the book in about five years, but without looking at it I could spout off an outline of it and details of it&rsquo;s main points - I can&rsquo;t think of many books that have made that big of an impression on my thinking.</p>
<p>The book isn&rsquo;t about PowerPoint. It&rsquo;s about drawing simple pictures, but every lesson in the book applies to PowerPoint. So much so that it&rsquo;s number 2 on my list.</p>
<h3><a title="Amazon link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Unfolding-Napkin-Hands-On-Problems-Pictures/dp/1591843197/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406813802&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">3. <em>Made to Stick</em> by Chip and Dan Heath</a></h3><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/madetostick.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1947" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/madetostick.jpg" alt="Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This is another book that isn&rsquo;t nescessarily about PowerPoint, but that every person who uses PowerPoint should probably read.</p>
<p>Chip and Dan Heath are brothers who both happen to be Ivy League Researches interested in the same topic: What makes information memorable or sticky? They came up with a short list of characteristics of &ldquo;Sticky&rdquo; communication and have given us an easy to remember acronym for those characteristics. Again, I haven&rsquo;t looked at the book in several years, but here is the acronym:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Unexpected</li>
<li>Credible</li>
<li>Concrete</li>
<li>Emotional</li>
<li>Story</li><br />
</ul><br />
For each of those points, the Heath brothers offer lots of great stories and statistics. This book will make a big impact on how you view communication.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Zen-Design-Principles-Presentations-ebook/dp/B00GXADSUU/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406813884&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=presentation+zen+design" target="_blank">4. <em>Presentation Zen Design</em> by Garr Reynolds</a></h3><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/presentation-zen.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1948" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/presentation-zen-246x300.jpg" alt="Presentation Zen Design by Garr Reynolds" width="246" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I hesitate to recommend this book, not because it isn&rsquo;t worth reading, but because you have to fight through the author&rsquo;s preocupation with Japanese Zen. That being said, it&rsquo;s still probably the best single book on the design element of PowerPoint slides available on the market.</p>
<p>Reynolds other books: Presentation Zen, and The Naked Presenter are also both worth reading, but have the same drawbacks.</p>
<h3><a title="amazon link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Brain-Rules-Updated-Expanded-Principles/dp/098326337X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406813915&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=brain+rules" target="_blank">5. <em>Brain Rules</em> by John Medina</a></h3><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/brain-rules.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1949" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/brain-rules-199x300.jpg" alt="Brain Rules by John Medina" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>John Medina is a brain scientist who has spent his lifetime studying how the human brain works. Based on his research, he&rsquo;s compiled twelve principles or Brain Rules.</p>
<p>There is a lot of good stuff in this book, and it&rsquo;s not about PowerPoint at all, but much of it applies to presentations. His stuff on the importance of visuals is very applicable.</p>
<p>Even though Dr. Medina claims to be a Christian, there is a LOT of talk about evolution in this book, so if you can&rsquo;t get past that, don&rsquo;t read it. If you can, you&rsquo;ll find some really interesting stuff in there to apply to various areas of your life including communication.</p>

<p>Like I said in the intro, I&rsquo;ve read many more books on PowerPoint and presenting than this - these just happen to be the ones that have been most influential to me, and they are the ones I would recommend you read as well.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I&rsquo;m going to wrap up this series with a tutorial on how to create a template for a Sermon Series, it&rsquo;s going to have a ton of screenshots and some free files you can download.</p>
