<p>Yesterday, I wrote a long post defending the use of commentaries. Check it out here. Someone suggested that I write about the different kinds of commentaries and to give some recommendations.</p>
<h2>Different types of commentaries:</h2></p>
<h3>Exegetical Commentaries</h3><br />
These are commentaries intended for serious students. They are usually written by scholars and very lengthy.</p>
<h3>Devotional Commentaries</h3><br />
These are commentaries written for laymen. They contain nowhere near as much detail as exegetical commentaries, but can still be helpful.</p>
<h3>Sermon Books</h3><br />
Many may not consider these to be commentaries, but books of sermons, especially books written by expository preachers, can be quite helpful. &nbsp;I often read the sermons of men like G. Campbell Morgan as commentaries.</p>
<h3>Historical helps</h3><br />
Again, many may not consider these to be commentaries, but there are several books explaining Bible history that I find especially useful in understanding historical and prophetic passages of scripture. (I think every pastor should have a copy of Leon Wood&rsquo;s two books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Survey-Israels-History-Leon-Wood/dp/031034770X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436385272&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=leon+wood">A Survey of Israel&rsquo;s History</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prophets-Israel-Leon-J-Wood/dp/0801021987/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436385272&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=leon+wood">The Prophets of Israel</a>.)</p>
<h2>Commentaries I Recommend:</h2><br />
Frankly, I don&rsquo;t think my recommendation is worth much. But here goes:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend investing in a huge series of commentaries. Rather, you should seek out the best commentaries for specific books of the Bible. This makes recommending them difficult. That being said, there are several series and authors that I have found are almost always helpful and almost always read their stuff if it is available:</p>
<h3>The Bible Speaks Today Series</h3><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/41cCNt-Uj7L._SX324_BO1204203200_.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2203" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/41cCNt-Uj7L._SX324_BO1204203200_-196x300.jpg" alt="41cCNt+Uj7L._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_" width="196" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Message-John-Bible-Speaks-Today/dp/0830812334/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436385336&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=The+Bible+Speaks+Today">This series of commentaries</a> (edited by John Stott and originally produced by IVP) is usually really good. I stumbled upon them at a yard sale when I was in college and knew nothing about commentaries - but I&rsquo;ve turned to them again and again. They are short and well written but also usually provide decent detail.</p>
<h3>The Preaching the Word Series</h3><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/71vWRqMAPCL._SL1500_.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2204" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/71vWRqMAPCL._SL1500_-199x300.jpg" alt="71vWRqMAPCL._SL1500_" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Romans-ESV-Righteousness-Heaven-Preaching/dp/1433536153/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436385387&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=PReaching+the+word">This set</a>, edited by R. Kent Hughes, I&rsquo;ve found to be consistently good. I&rsquo;ve especially enjoyed the commentaries on 1 Timothy and Ephesians.</p>
<h3>The New American Commentary Series</h3><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/51Dke0TTIKL._SX331_BO1204203200_.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2205" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/51Dke0TTIKL._SX331_BO1204203200_-200x300.jpg" alt="51Dke0TTIKL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-American-Commentary-Judges-Ruth-ebook/dp/B004T0AB3S/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436385435&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=new+american+commentary">I&rsquo;ve bought three of these</a> and enjoyed all of them. When I was preaching through Exodus and Leviticus - I was really helped by the offerings from this series.</p>
<h3>Exploring the Bible Commentary Series by John Phillips</h3><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/9k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2206" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/9k-199x300.jpg" alt="9k=" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exploring-Ephesians-Philippians-Phillips-Commentary/dp/0825434769/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436385488&amp;sr=8-9&amp;keywords=exploring+john+phillips">These commentaries</a> are really popular among independent Baptists because they use the King James and have tons of alliteration. I don&rsquo;t like the alliteration, but I&rsquo;ve found that if you can get past it and actually read the content - there is a lot of good stuff there.</p>
<h3>MacArthur New Testament Commentary</h3><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2Q.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2207" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2Q-188x300.jpg" alt="2Q==" width="188" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/MacArthur-Testament-Commentary-Macarthur-Serie/dp/0802410308/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436385553&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=macarthur+commentary">I almost always buy one of these </a>when I&rsquo;m going to start a book study. While I don&rsquo;t always agree with MacArthur, his commentaries are a fantastic place to go for historical and linguistic information about the text. His commentaries on Matthew and 1 Corinthians should be in everyone library.</p>
<h3>Anything by D. Martyn Lloyd Jones</h3><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2208" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Z-196x300.jpg" alt="Z" width="196" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Martyn Lloyd Jones has commentary series on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Studies-Sermon-Mount-Martyn-Lloyd-Jones/dp/080280036X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436385663&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=studies+in+the+sermon+on+the+mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Christian-Unity-Exposition-Ephesians-1-16/dp/0801057973/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436385608&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=ephesians+lloyd+jones">Ephesians</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Romans-Vol-Exposition-Chapter-Gospel/dp/0851514677/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436385681&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=romans+lloyd+jones">Romans</a>. Almost everything he wrote is worth reading and is usually the best there is.</p>
<h3>The &ldquo;Be&rdquo; Series by Warren Weirsbe</h3><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2Q-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2209" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2Q-1-198x300.jpg" alt="2Q==-1" width="198" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Be-Mature-James-Growing-Commentary-ebook/dp/B005MTBIOG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436385716&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=be+wiersbe">These are definitely devotional commentaries</a> and often - I don&rsquo;t get much from them. But I do read them from time to time.</p>
<h3>The &ldquo;For You&rdquo; series by Tim Keller</h3><br />
<a href="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/51uFAcpM6nL._SX310_BO1204203200_.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2210" src="http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/wp-content/uploads/51uFAcpM6nL._SX310_BO1204203200_-188x300.jpg" alt="51uFAcpM6nL._SX310_BO1,204,203,200_" width="188" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>There <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Judges-You-Reading-Feeding-Leading/dp/190876290X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436385765&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=judges+for+you">are only a few of these out</a>, but they are some of the best devotional commentaries available. I&rsquo;ve especially enjoyed Keller&rsquo;s take on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Judges-You-Reading-Feeding-Leading/dp/190876290X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436385765&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=judges+for+you">Judges</a> (which is a difficult book to find good info on.)</p>
<hr />
<p>I could mention others for specific books, but these are good places to start if you are just starting out your library. Many of these are available for Kindle too - so you can download them and save space and money.</p>

<h2>Commentary Cautions</h2><br />
There are a couple of problem areas where, if you are like me, you will probably disagree with the commentator:</p>
<h3>Eschatology</h3><br />
Many otherwise good commentary writers write from a preterist post-millennial or amillennial eschatological viewpoint. If you have your eschatology settled - just watch for that.</p>
<h3>Calvinism</h3><br />
Most commentary writers, both alive and dead, write from a calvinistic perspective. Just be prepared for that.</p>
<h3>Ecclesiology</h3><br />
I read commentaries written by presbyterians and other non-baptists. You have to take into account their varying ecclesiology when you get to passages like 1 Timothy and Ephesians 4.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. What are your favorite commentaries? Let me know in the comments.</p>
