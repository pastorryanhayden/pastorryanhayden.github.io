<p>In Jeremiah 5, Jeremiah is looking around the country for righteous people pleading that God wouldn&rsquo;t send judgment. It&rsquo;s a very similar passage to the one in Genesis, where Abraham asks God if He would spare Sodom if a small number of righteous people lived there. In the first couple of verses, Jeremiah looks through the common people of Judah and finds no righteousness. But they have an excuse, Jeremiah says, maybe they haven&rsquo;t been trained. Or to use his exact words:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;Therefore I said, surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
So, if the common people don&rsquo;t have it, where else is Jeremiah going to look? His answer - to the great men. To the upper classes. To the educated. They won&rsquo;t have the same excuse. So in verse 5 Jeremiah says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD and the judgement of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke and burst the bonds.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
At the end of the chapter, Jeremiah judges that these great men are just as, if not even more wicked than the commoners. Verse 27 says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. They are waxen fat, they shine; yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
Clearly, this is a chapter about wickedness of the people, both common and &ldquo;great&rdquo;, of Judah and about God&rsquo;s justness in punishing them.</p>
<p><strong>But John Hamblin and the Sword of the Lord doesn&rsquo;t see it that way.</strong> In the last issue of the Sword, prominently featured on the front page, is a sermon by John Hamblin entitled <strong>&ldquo;Get thee unto great men.&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong>(Vol. LXXX, No. 25 - December 5, 2014) In which Dr. Hamblin takes the phrase of Jeremiah <em>&ldquo;I will get me unto the great men&rdquo;</em> and tries to tell us that we should have and revere heroes (by which I think he means Jack Hyles, Tom Malone, Lee Roberson and company) and that we should dwell on their accomplishments while glossing over their failures.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you my front end summation of the sermon and then flesh it out: <strong>It was dishonest, vapid, and anti-biblical and the Sword should print a retraction and apology.</strong></p>
<h2>It was dishonest.</h2><br />
I don&rsquo;t know about Dr. Hamblin, but I do know that Shelton Smith knows a little bit about Hermeneutics. I can remember hearing him preach many, many times and the one thing I remember about his preaching was that he took the time to explain what the words meant (even going sometimes to Hebrew or Greek.) I don&rsquo;t agree with the direction Shelton Smith has taken the Sword of the Lord over the last several years (more on that in a minute), but I don&rsquo;t think Shelton Smith is stupid or ignorant. I think he probably knows that that verse in Jeremiah actually teaches almost the total opposite of what Dr. Hamblin tried to make it mean in that sermon. If he doesn&rsquo;t know it, I think he could know it in about five minutes of study.</p>
<p>So why print the sermon? Maybe he didn&rsquo;t read it. Maybe he&rsquo;s ok with people twisting the scripture. Maybe he&rsquo;s so fed up with bloggers and &ldquo;pseudo-fundamentalists&rdquo; that he was ok with it. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I do know that Paul said (and this isn&rsquo;t out of context) that He had <em>&rdquo;renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully.&rdquo;</em> (2 Cor. 4:2) The premise of the sermon twisted scripture to make a partisan point and if that isn&rsquo;t <em>&ldquo;handling the word of God deceitfully&rdquo;</em> I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>
<h2>It was vapid.</h2><br />
Who defines &ldquo;the great men?&rdquo; Who decides what parts of the legacy of these &ldquo;great men&rdquo; is to be binding on all future generations and which part to ignore?</p>
<p>For example, I think both Shelton Smith and John Hamblin would say that John R. Rice was a great man (as would I). Should we impose Rice&rsquo;s views on tithing, divorce, King James onlyism, or working with other denominations on all future generations? What about Frank Norris? He&rsquo;s often heralded as a &ldquo;great man.&rdquo; What parts of his legacy are binding?</p>
<p>What if our heroes don&rsquo;t line up with yours? Who decides who was great? What if I think Charles Spurgeon was great (judging by the number of times the SOTL has published Spurgeon&rsquo;s material, at least at some point they did too.) Charles Spurgeon had a totally different philosophy and even a different theology than Tom Malone and Jack Hyles. So whose legacy am I bound by?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vapid idea, because no one is defining the criteria for what makes someone &ldquo;great&rdquo; or &ldquo;a spiritual giant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of these things are HUGE problems, but my biggest problem with the sermon is&hellip;</p>
<h2>It is anti-biblical</h2><br />
By that I don&rsquo;t just mean that the main idea of the sermon isn&rsquo;t found in the Bible, that would be bad enough. <strong>No, what I mean is that the Bible actually teaches the OPPOSITE of what this sermon suggests.</strong></p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians, the Corinthian church was splintering into little cliques who were each rallying around a spiritual hero. (Kind of like what parts of the IFB movement seem to be doing right now) and Paul spent four chapters correcting this (1 Cor. 1-4). There are four chapters of prime New Testament real estate combatting preacher worship and factionalism!</p>
<p>So, to Dr. Hamblin I'd say: I&rsquo;ll see you your one verse in Jeremiah that&rsquo;s been pried from it&rsquo;s context and twisted to mean the opposite of what it says and I&rsquo;ll raise you 1 Corinthians 1-4. But if you aren&rsquo;t in the mood to read all of that, I&rsquo;ll just give you one verse. It&rsquo;s not a personal statement like Jeremiah&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s actually a command for the&nbsp;church age:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&rdquo;Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;&rdquo;</em></blockquote></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><br />
I actually want to like the Sword of the Lord. I appreciate it&rsquo;s historical position within the independent Baptist movement. I&rsquo;ve long been a fan of John R. Rice, I got most of my education in a building named after Curtis Hutson, and I have heard Dr. Smith preach many times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my opinion that if the Sword of the Lord wants to remain relevant to my generation that they need to start taking hermeneutics more seriously and need to inch away from (what I perceive to be) their increasingly factionalistic posture.</p>
