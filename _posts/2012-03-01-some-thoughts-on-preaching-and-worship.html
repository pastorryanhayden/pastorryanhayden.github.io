The first of our four purposes as a church is to "worship", yet we spend little time in what many churches would categorize as "worship". We don't have a praise band leading us to repeat "I could sing of your love forever" 53 times. We don't gather together in an architectural masterpiece complete with stained glass windows, statuary, and dozens of well placed candles. We don't even have a bunch of brown clad bald headed monks singing gregorian chants at the beginning of our services. So what do we do that we can say is worship?</p>
<p>Biblically speaking, worship has nothing to do with architecture, with music, or with chanting monks. Biblically speaking, worship is putting God in His proper place. The classic passage on worship is found in Isaiah 6, where we see Isaiah ushered into the thrown room of God and we see God worshipped in this habitat. I encourage you to read that passage when you get a chance. If you do, I think you'll find the following three things to be true about worship.</p>
<h3>1. When God is really worshipped, we see Him as He is.</h3><br />
When Isaiah saw God, he saw Him as "<em>sitting upon a throne, high and holy and lifted up</em>", angels surrounded Him singing "<em>Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hosts</em>", and the whole temple shook at the voice of the angels. (Imagine how it would have shook if God himself spoke). When God is really worshipped, we see Him as He really is.</p>
<p>While it is possible and important to worship God in song (Psalms is the longest book in the Bible), there is no greater way of worshiping God as who He is than in the preaching and teaching of the Word through which He reveals himself. This is why far more is said in scripture about the early church coming together to study and hear preaching than is said about them coming together to sing. If worshipping God means declaring who He is, then there is no better way to worship than proclaiming His self-revelation.</p>
<h3>When God is really worshipped, we see ourselves as we really are.</h3><br />
When Isaiah saw who God really was, it moved him to cry out "<em>Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips.</em>" When we really see God as who He is, it becomes all the more clear who we are: unclean sinners before a holy God. As we study God's word together and come under the conviction it brings, we are worshipping God by admitting who we are in light of who He is. Real worship always brings us to an awareness of our sin.</p>
<h3>When God is really worshipped, it moves us to action.</h3><br />
When Isaiah saw who God really was and saw who he really was; he responded to the call of God. God said, "<em>Whom shall I send?</em>", and Isaiah replied, "<em>Here am I; send me.</em>"</p>
<p>When we really worship God, it will lead us to act for God.</p>
<p>So what is the primary act of worship of our church? The preaching of the Word! When we preach God's Word, we declare God as He declares Himself. When we preach God's Word, we are convicted of our sinful condition. When we preach God's Word, we are moved to act on His Word. All of this is the very definition of worship.</p>
