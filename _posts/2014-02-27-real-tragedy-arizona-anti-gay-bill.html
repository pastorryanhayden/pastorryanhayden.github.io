<p>Below is a letter to the editor I submitted to our local newspaper:</p>
<p>Listening to the media coverage of Arizona's "anti-gay" bill saga over the last week, you'd think that it was the most hateful and backwards document ever penned by a state legislature. Seriously. You'd think the entire thing was a deliberate attempt to roll back anti-discrimination laws to the Jim Crow era and that the bill itself was dripping with homophobic vitriol.</p>
<p>Did anybody read it?</p>
<p>I did. Nowhere in it's whopping one and a half pages was there a single line that could be interpreted by any objective person as homophobic. In fact, nowhere in it's pages was there even a veiled reference to homosexuality.</p>
<p>The bill did not, contrary to the media hype, allow for a business to discriminate on religious grounds. All it did was give business owners the right to make their case in court that a law unnecessarily encroaches on their sincerely held religious beliefs and practices. It said nothing to color the outcome of the court case, it only gave religious business owners the right to a court case in the first place. It did nothing more than mirror the language of an existing federal law championed a decade ago by such a conservative religious bigot as Ted Kennedy, and would have added Arizona to the 18 states that have already accepted that language in their state definition of religious liberty. (None of which are allowing Christian restaurant owners to refuse lunch to a gay man.)</p>
<p>Even if you hate the bill - even if you are so anti-religion that you believe people's right to exercise their faith stops one step past the church door - you should be alarmed that the state of journalism has disintegrated so much that things no longer have to be proven discriminatory to meet with journalistic outrage. No, anything that even seems to hinder the very new political correctness in our society will have to overcome a tidal wave of universal media disdain.</p>
<p>You might see Jan Brewer's veto last week as a moment of triumph for gay rights, it very well may have been, but it was definitely a moment when hype and spin triumphed over actual content. People's most deepest right was on the line, the right to follow their conscience, and the media ran with boilerplate propaganda at the expense of the truth. That should be scary to more than just religious people.</p>
