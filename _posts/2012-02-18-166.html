<p>Here is a question for you:</p>
<blockquote><p>If an idea cannot stand because it isn't derived from the Bible, and if an idea can't stand by the virtue of its principles, does it deserve to stand?</blockquote><br />
In the debate about where fundamentalism has been going, its defenders have consistently relied on the <strong>slippery slope argument</strong> in it's defense.</p>
<p>The slippery slope argument goes like this: <em>If you change that, or challenge this assumption, or (you fill in the blank) then the next thing you know, you'll be wearing mini-skirts to church and having a rock concert instead of worship and your people will become weak insipid Christians.</em> In other words, don't take even the slightest step away from <em>where you are</em>, because you might be on a slippery slope and that one position was the rock keeping you from falling into the abyss.</p>

<p>I see three problems with this line of thinking:</p>
<h3>First, it could be applied to anything.</h3><br />
If you've always held the position that churches shouldn't have curtains on their windows or that blonde haired, brown eyed males from Topeka shouldn't use the word "is" you could use the slippery slope argument. "If we let those toeheads from Kansas start using being verbs, we're in for a heap of trouble", "If we let the church hang up drapes, then we are speeding toward compromise."</p>
<p>At what point do you decide to invoke the slippery slope argument? We could be living like the Amish if we followed that line of thinking. It's a completely subjective thing.</p>
<p>(There are times when it makes sense to talk about slippery slopes: when the principles of a decision logically lead to worse and worse consequences. Spurgeon's <em>Downgrade Controversy</em> is a good example. Unfortunately, most people don't put as much thought into invoking the slippery slope argument as Mr. Spurgeon did.)</p>
<h3>Second, it doesn't really deal with ideas or principles being discussed.</h3><br />
Most of the time people invoke the slippery slope argument, it isn't really an argument at all so much as it is a refusal to think about the topic. It's far easier to talk about slippery slopes than to think through the implications and biblical mandate for a certain change.</p>
<h3>Third, it shows you are more anchored to your current position than to scripture.</h3><br />
Paul praised the Berean Christians because they weighed his every word against scripture, not because they drew a line in the sand and said "if it's new, it aint true". The truth is, if your orthodoxy is a biblical orthodoxy, then you have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>The problem comes when people base their decisions around a hand drawn map of what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, in stead of looking for guidance from the compass of principles from scripture. The hand drawn map is useless when the landmarks change, take a hand drawn map from the early 1800s to Chicago and see how much good it does you. Principles from scripture can guide you through any time of change.</p>

<p>In stead of asking "Is this going to send me down a slippery slope?" Why not ask "What does God's word say about this?" <em>If God's word, either in principle or precept, condemns the change than we don't need to take one step closer to it. If God's word is mute on the issue, then maybe its worth thinking and arguing about.</em></p>
