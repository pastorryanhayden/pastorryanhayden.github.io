<p>Recently, I was talking to a pastor friend about special speakers and some of the problems he&rsquo;d had with them, and I mentioned that I sent &ldquo;special speaker policies&rdquo; to all prospective speakers at our church. I learned this from my pastor in Tennessee, (he had policies for everything) and I think it has saved us a lot of grief.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say we&rsquo;ve got everything figured out in this department. (We&rsquo;ve been guilty of under compensating special speakers and I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out the best way of handling that.)</p>
<p>Pastors, do you think this is too much? Do you do anything similar with your special speakers? If not, in what ways do you &ldquo;protect your pulpit?&rdquo; Are there any things you would add or take away from this list?</p>
