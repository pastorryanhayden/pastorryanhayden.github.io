<p>This weekend, I had the pleasure of hosting Bryan Ries and family (and he's got a big one) at Bible Baptist. &nbsp;For those of you who don't know, Bryan is the host of The Ministry Connection podcast, and over the weekend I confirmed what I had suspected listening to the first few episodes, that we thought the same way about many, many things related to IFB ministry.</p>
<p>This morning, we sat together in his super-high tech portable recording studio (ok, we were huddled around a single microphone in a hotel business center) to record an interview about my book. &nbsp;The sound wasn't great, and I was really nervous, but enjoyed the opportunity.</p>
<p>If you've got a few minutes, head on over to the podcast and listen. &nbsp;If you haven't yet, I highly recommend you subscribe to Bryan's podcast. &nbsp;It's great and I look forward to it every week.</p>
