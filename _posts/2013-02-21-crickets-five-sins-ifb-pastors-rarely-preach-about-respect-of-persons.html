<p>Too many of us have turned</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.&rdquo;</em> (Mark 16:15)</blockquote><br />
into</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every Caucasian, middle class, morally upright, upwardly mobile, conservatively dressed person between the ages of six and sixty.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
Instead of going into the highways and the hedges and calling the lame and halt and blind and deaf to our Lord&rsquo;s table we go into other people&rsquo;s banquets and try to get the already full to come over to our house for dessert. Our Lord said <em>&ldquo;I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.&rdquo;</em> but we, if we were honest, would say &ldquo;I am not come to call the sinners, but the righteous to repeatance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m guilty of all of the sins I&rsquo;ve been talking about this week, but in this area I feel very guilty.</p>
<p>Scripture calls this sin &ldquo;Respect of Persons&rdquo; and it has a lot to say about it. Consider this passage in James 2.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. 2 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; 3 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: 4 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;5 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? 6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats? 7 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;8 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
On top of this passage that emphasizes the wrongness of respecting persons in the church, the Bible also tells us several times that our God is no respecter of persons. (Deut. 10:17, Acts 10:34, Ephesians 6:8&ndash;9, etc.) Obviously, this is an important characteristic of God&rsquo;s that He wants to be a characteristic of the church as well. But we all tend to be respecters of persons.</p>
<p>How is this sin committed?</p>
<h3 id="wehaverespectofpersonswhenwebringculturalprejudicesintothelordshouse.">We have respect of persons when we bring cultural prejudices into the Lord&rsquo;s house.</h3><br />
The passage above mentions prejudiced or unfair treatment based on the appearance of poverty, but I don&rsquo;t think we do the text any injustice when we apply it to other forms of prejudice in the church as well. I&rsquo;ve visited in churches that seemed to be prejudiced against rich people. I&rsquo;ve been in churches with a strong anti-intellectual bent. I&rsquo;ve visited in places down south where putting down "yankees" was common fair or where racial prejudice abounded in the church.</p>
<p>The truth is God wants us to try to give the gospel to all of the people groups in our area, not just those who &ldquo;match&rdquo; our church body. When people who don&rsquo;t seem to be a good fit, because of their racial, economic, educational or social background are saved, we should treat them fairly. If Jesus died for all people, and purchased people different than us with his blood, then they deserve equal treatment inside of our churches and equal attention in our outreach.</p>
<h3 id="wehaverespectofpersonswhenwehavebadideasaboutsinners.">We have respect of persons when we have bad ideas about sinners.</h3><br />
I live near a pretty big university. Like any major state university, it predominantly liberal-progressive, predominantly non-Christian and has a large influence in our area. Very few of the people we see at this university look like, talk like, or vote like the members of my church. The temptation is to write off this university as the domain of sinners and attempt nothing.</p>
<p>Although my town is pretty churched, we have a large amount of bars. The people who frequent those bars, for the most part, don&rsquo;t look like the people who attend our church. They look like people living in sin. It&rsquo;s a temptation to write off that whole segment of our population as past the gospel.</p>
<p>But who did Jesus minister to? He spent his time with publicans and sinners. He ministered to prostitutes and other &ldquo;untouchables&rdquo; in the jewish moralistic society. He was even accused by some of being a glutton and a winebibber.</p>
<p>There is a big difference in the attitude that wants to convert sinners and that wants to destroy sinners. Too often we take an us-vs-them stance toward those whose lifestyles are less than morally upright or towards those whose world views are at odds with our own. We involve ourselves vocally in political posturing, even from the pulpit, that all but ensures we will have no influence with those on the other side of the world view divide. Our Lord dealt the death blow to sin, but He did it while being a friend of sinners. If we can&rsquo;t learn to get past judging people and start reaching people, we aren&rsquo;t going to make much headway for the cause of Christ.</p>
<h3 id="wehaverespectofpersonswhenwearebuildingourempireinsteadofchrists.">We have respect of persons when we are building our empire instead of Christ&rsquo;s.</h3><br />
Going back to the James text, why would a person discriminate against a poor looking person in a church service? That&rsquo;s not a difficult question to answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>A poor person isn&rsquo;t going to tithe as much.</li>
<li>A poor person is going to lower the appearances of a wealthy church.</li>
<li>A poor person might have bad manners.</li>
<li>Loving a poor person might cost the church financially as they help him through fiscal difficulties.</li>
<li>Need I go on?</li><br />
</ul><br />
Proverbs 28:21 says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;21 To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
<strong>At the root, the reason we have respect of persons is because of greed and pride</strong>. We want our church to look better, to attract a crowd with money, to be socially acceptable, etc. When we are doing this, we are building our own empire, not Christ&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get to build Christ&rsquo;s church, that&rsquo;s His job. We don&rsquo;t get to pick and chose amongst those whom He&rsquo;s purchased with His blood. All of God&rsquo;s people are precious to Him, even those (perhaps especially those) who are devalued by society.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not be guilty of &ldquo;respect of persons,&rdquo; let&rsquo;s emphasize what scripture emphasizes.</p>
