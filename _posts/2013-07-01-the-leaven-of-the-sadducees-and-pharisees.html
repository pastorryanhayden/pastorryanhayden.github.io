<p>I preached two significant sermons (at least for me) yesterday. &nbsp;One of them was a topical message on clothes that was similar to my <a title="Why I Am For And Against Dressing Up For Church" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/why-i-am-for-and-against-dressing-up-for-church/">church clothes post from last week</a>, you can view it here:</p>

<p>The other was a sermon on the <em><a href="http://biblebaptistmattoon.org/multimedia-archive/the-leaven-of-the-sadducees-and-pharisees/">"Leaven of the Sadducees and Pharisees"</a>&nbsp;</em>from <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/Matthew16%3A1-12" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">Matthew 16:1-12</a>. &nbsp;In my opinion, understanding Christ's position in contrast to the Sadducees and Pharisees is essential for having biblical balance. &nbsp;Both groups were deceiving people with religion: &nbsp;One (the pharisees) were presenting a legalistic emphasis and adding to the scriptures. &nbsp;The other (the Sadducees) presented the Old Testament with a liberal emphasis and subtracted from &nbsp;the scriptures. &nbsp;Both groups started with the same source material (the Old Testament) and ended up with something totally foreign from what God intended.</p>
<p>Towards the end I talked a little about how balance comes from &nbsp;sticking close to the scriptures. &nbsp;As a pastor, I have no intention of dancing for the super-conservative pipers who would add rules to the scripture or reduce the scripture to a bunch of rules and traditions, but we also must be weary of those who would turn the scriptures into a mere textbook and our religion into mere ritual.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you want something to listen to (or read - although reading my manuscripts may be painful!) here you go:</p>
