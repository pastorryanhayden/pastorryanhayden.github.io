<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1></p>
<h2 id="whyasermonmanuscript">Why a sermon manuscript</h2><br />
When I preach, I prefer to have a sermon manuscript. Now this does not mean that I read a manuscript. I am a firm believer that there is a difference between reading and preaching, but I don&rsquo;t feel prepared unless I have a manuscript written, and I have wrestled with ways to get that manuscript into the pulpit in a manageable way.</p>
<p>My iPad fills that need for a couple of reasons. First, my average manuscript is about 15 typewritten pages long, and with my iPad, I don&rsquo;t have to cary 15 pages into the pulpit and constantly be shuffling paper around. Second, I can use the table of contents feature in iBooks to look at a rough outline of my sermon while I preach, and touch the points and sub points if I need to refer to the details of my manuscript.</p>
<p>This has been by no means an easy thing to figure out, and I am constantly tweaking it to make it better, but I think I&rsquo;ve finally stumbled upon a way to do this manageably.</p>
<h2 id="whatyoullneed">What you&rsquo;ll need</h2><br />
All you really need to do this is</p>
<ul>
<li>an iPad (you could also use any other tablet or ereader, but these instructions are for the iPad)</li>
<li>a plain text editor (I use <a title="Notational Velocity Alt" href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/" target="_blank">nvAlt</a> on the mac which syncs with my iPad so I can always write.)</li>
<li><a title="Calibre Program" href="http://calibre-ebook.com/" target="_blank">Calibre</a> - a free tool that converts plain text to ePub.</li>
<li>A program to make a cover image - I use InDesign and have a template set up, then convert it to a jpg file. <em>This is totally optional, your sermon will work just fine without a cover image.</em></li><br />
</ul></p>
<h1 id="writethesermoninplaintextusingmarkdown">Write the sermon in plain text using Markdown</h1><br />
I used to write everything in either <a title="Evernote" href="http://evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> or Microsoft Word. Both of these programs have a lot of great features, but they also have a lot of distracting features. I have found that (for me) the best way to write is in a simple plain text file using a syntax called <a title="About Markdown" href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a>.</p>
<p>What is Markdown? Markdown is a way to write HTML without writing HTML. You get the structure of HTML (Heading 1, Heading 2, Emphasis, Strong, Blockquote, Etc.) Without having to worry about tags. <strong>This took me literally ten minutes to learn and it saves so much time.</strong> It just lets me write, without worrying about formatting, without worrying about what programs can and can&rsquo;t open my files. I can&rsquo;t recommend it enough - it is super simple.</p>
<p>I write my sermons in a free mac app called nvAlt, a fork off of another free mac app called Notational Velocity. The benefits of this app for me is that it has a full screen editor, which makes all of the distractions go away, and it automatically saves and syncs online with <a title="Simple Note" href="http://simplenoteapp.com/" target="_blank">SimpleNote</a>, which means I can access the text files on my iPad whenever I have ideas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to tell you how to write the sermon, thats <a title="My Sermon Writing Workflow" href="http://ryan-hayden.com/?p=48" target="_blank">the real fun part</a>, just how to set up an already written sermon so you can view it on your iPad.</p>
<h1 id="setupcalibreforyouripad">Set up Calibre for your iPad</h1><br />
Calibre is a great program with an awful interface. I usually don&rsquo;t use software that is this ugly, but it does the job, costs me nothing, and I can&rsquo;t find an alternative so I am stuck with it.</p>
<p>Setting up Calibre is a little overwhelming at first, but if you do it write you should only have to do it once.</p>
<h2 id="settingupcalibrepreferencesforthisworkflow">Setting up Calibre preferences for this workflow</h2><br />

<h3 id="neverlookatthatpreferencepaneagain">Never look at that preference pane again!</h3></p>
<h1 id="dragtheplaintextfileintocalibre">Drag the plain text file into Calibre</h1><br />
Now that Calibre is set up, it is a fairly easy task to turn our Markdown formatted plain text into pretty iPad eBooks with usable tables of contents. We just need to add the file to Calibre.</p>
<p>Adding the file to Calibre is as easy as &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>opening the Calibre window</li>
<li>finding your plain text file in finder or windows explorer</li>
<li>dragging the file onto the Calibre window.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<h1 id="converttheplaintextfileintoepub">Convert the plain text file into ePub</h1></p>
<ul>
<li>To convert your file into ePub format, just make sure that your file is selected in the main window and click on the &ldquo;Convert Books&rdquo; button. (It looks like a book.)&nbsp;<a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/calibre-Calibre-Library-.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79" title="calibre - || Calibre Library ||" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2011/09/calibre-Calibre-Library--300x172.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="172" /></a></li>
<li>In the window that pops up you only need to change things on the first section. &nbsp;<a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Convert-Jude.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-89" title="Convert Jude" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2011/09/Convert-Jude-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" /></a>
<ul>
<li>Change the &ldquo;Output Format&rdquo; to ePub.</li>
<li>Change the Title, Author, Etc, information if you want.</li>
<li>Drag an 600 x 800 pixel cover image into the cover panel if you want a cover.</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;</li><br />
</ul><br />
</li><br />
</ul></p>
<h1 id="gettheepubfileintoitunes">Get the ePub file into iTunes</h1><br />
Getting the ePub file into iTunes is fairly easy. You just need to get to the ePub file on your computer and drag the file to the iTunes icon in the dock (if you are using a mac) or to the iTunes window (on windows). The easiest way to get to the ePub file is to select your newly created manuscript in the main Calibre window and on the right, underneath the large book icon, click the text that says &ldquo;Click to Open.&rdquo; You can then just drag the file onto either the iTunes icon or the iTunes window.</p>
<h1 id="syncupyouripad">Sync up your iPad</h1><br />
Now all you have to do is sync up your iPad. Plug it in, wait a few minutes and you&rsquo;ll have a very functional sermon manuscript.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1><br />
While this may seem like a lot of work, it goes by pretty quickly after you&rsquo;ve done it one or two times and the benefits are well worth it. &nbsp;Below is a short video of the finished product. &nbsp;(Sorry, it's not very good.)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MQ1y4PsE3DM" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Let me conclude with a couple of tips about preaching from an iPad.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn the brightness way down. If the brightness is all the way up it is going to look like your are preaching with a spotlight on your face.  You don't necessarily want to hide the fact that you are using an iPad, but you don't want it to be a distration.</li>
<li>If you can, preach without glasses.  Any backlit screen is going to glare in your glasses and people will notice.</li>
<li>Lock the screen orientation.  The easiest way to do this is to set it up in system preferences so the little switch on the side (above the volume button) locks the orientation.  This will keep you from fussing over screen orientation.</li>
<li>Consider using a non-obvious iPad cover.  I have an iPad cover that my wife made for me out of an old day planner.  It just looks like a leather book, I don't use it all the time, but it does make it a little less obvious that I am preaching from an iPad.</li><br />
