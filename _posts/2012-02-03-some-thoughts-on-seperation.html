<p>This sunday, as a part of an another sermon, I am going to be preaching for a few minutes on separation. I have no problem with biblical separation, the Bible plainly says "come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord." and calls us a "peculiar people". Jesus said of his disciples that he had "chosen them out of the world" and therefore the world would hate them. No one with intelectual honesty can argue that the New Testament doesn't plainly teach separation from the world. As someone committed to preaching "the whole counsel of God", not to preach on separation is failure: plain and simple.</p>
<p>I do however want to make something clear. The call to separate from the world is not the call to be a culture warrior. I've seen tracts, printed by independent baptists, whose sole point was that Jesus didn't have a beard and we shouldn't either. &nbsp;They say that when his beard was plucked out before his crucifixion it was just because the day's events (the last supper, praying in the garden, his betrayal and trial) had prevented him from being able to shave. Now it is no coincidence that this tract was printed in the late 1960's in the middle of America's cultural upheavel and when "hippies" were influencial. The tract wasn't about Jesus so much as it was a desperate attempt to influence fundamentalist views of the culture war &nbsp;going on at the time. Unfortunately, a lot of this has spilled over to subsequent generations of Independent Baptists.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the changes brought about by the culture war from the 60's and 70's were negative and opposed to biblical concepts: The defeminization of women, disrespect of authority, widespread sexual immorality, acceptance of crudeness and crassness in society, etc.. Here's the thing though - they happened, and they happened forty years ago. We're not going back.</p>
<p>So why does it seem like many fundamentalists define "separation", at least when it comes to standards and such in 1960's and 1970's terms? If you're a guy you must be clean shaven, you must wear a comb-over, you must carry on the 1960's cultural preference for dressing up. If you're a lady you must wear a dress always, unless you are involved in sporting events in which case you must wear cullotes.</p>
<p>Here is what I am getting at: we need to be separate from the world not because we are taking sides in a culture war, but because our life is lived according to biblical principles. Respect for authority and the older generations is a biblical principle, gender identity and modesty are biblical principles, sexual purity is commanded in the Bible, let's teach and adhere to these and be willing to let go of some of what we have traditionally defined as "separation" but really probably flew in under the radar during the culture war of the 60's and 70's.</p>
<p>I think it is possible to honor the legacy of men like John R. Rice, Jack Hyles, Lee Robberson and Bob Jones Sr. without confounding an entire generation by demanding they hold onto leftovers from another generation's culture war.</p>
