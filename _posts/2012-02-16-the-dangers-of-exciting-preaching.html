<p>In my last post on fundamentalism, I made this statement:</p></p>
<blockquote><p>In my opinion, every single problem that fundamentalism is grappling with today flows from our movement&rsquo;s weak spot for charismatic speakers who refuse to limit themselves to &ldquo;rightly dividing the word of truth&rdquo;.</blockquote></p>
<p>We fundamentalists love our exciting preachers. Of course, each of us has our own definition of what exciting is: Some people like to hear a guy who stand behind the pulpit and "rips face" and<a href="http://www.examiner.com/humanist-in-portland/wv-pastor-jeff-hunt-a-homo-owens-burn-and-shoot-fags-video#ixzz1mZXgq1ec"> incites controversy</a>, while others like someone who yells, hacks, or runs around constantly. We hear people say things all the time like "that will preach", "can I get an amen", and "bless God".</p></p>
<p>Where did all of this come from? Do we really think that Paul stood up at Athens and called for amens, or that Jesus punctuated the Sermon on the Mount with "Bless Go-ods"? Do christians who live in other countries or who have lived in other ages show the same preference for warped communication from the pulpit? My limited experience in reading history and traveling is that for the most part they don't or didn't.</p></p>
<p>Could it be that our hunger for "exciting" preaching has led us away from biblical preaching?</p></p>
<p>My favorite preachers are true exciting preachers. They have the ability to hold my attention, they know how to speak clearly, and they can speak with authority. However, they are my favorite preachers because of what they say, not how they say it. In other words, they are exciting because they follow what Charles Spurgeon said was the golden rule of keeping peoples <a href="http://www.cblibrary.net/pastoral_aids/spurgeon_lectures/lms_09.htm">attention</a> - <em>say something worth listening to</em>.</p></p>
<p>I want to lay out several dangers of exciting preaching (I'll write later on this week about dangers of intellectual preaching). These aren't meant to dissuade you from being an exciting preacher, but to dissuade you from setting excitement as a goal - or worse - as a measuring stick for other preachers.</p></p>
<p>So here they are my 6 reasons why exciting preaching is dangerous:</p></p>
<h2>1. Exciting preaching can cause more attention to be on the preacher than on the word.</h2></p>
<p>Read the recorded sermons in scripture and you'll see that the emphasis was on what was said, not on how it was said. There is no doubt that Peter spoke with a loud voice when he preached at Pentecost or that John the Baptist had to project to be heard as he preached by the Jordan River, but the emphasis in scripture is on what they said, not on how they said it.</p></p>
<p>We are commanded in scripture to "preach the word". Paul said that he had preached "the whole counsel of God". John the Baptist was just a "voice crying in the wilderness". The point is, God's word, God's message is the important thing, not the speaking style of the person giving it.</p></p>
<p>There is definitely a "gift of prophecy". It takes a giftedness to preach and hold people's attention, but it is the message, not the messenger which should be attended to. In my opinion, the best preachers get out of the way and let God speak through His word.</p></p>
<h2>2. Exciting preaching is often based on a misunderstanding of history.</h2></p>
<p>Why do preachers yell? Why do some preachers hack or clear their throat constantly (even though there is nothing wrong with their throats)? Why do some preachers seem like a totally different person when they are preaching than in normal conversation? I would say invariably it is because they grew up around preachers who acted like that, so they don't feel like a preacher if they aren't acting like that. Probably, the people they are imitating are imitating someone, and on and on it goes.</p></p>
<p>Consider this. 100 years ago preachers didn't have microphones. Popular preachers would have to preach to hundreds or even thousands of people in large, non-air-conditioned rooms with absolutely no amplification. Charles Spurgeon wouldn't even take a preacher into the Pastor's College that didn't have a strong voice. So loud boisterous preaching made sense in its time, but its time is over. &nbsp;<em>(Actually, even in its time it was criticized. &nbsp;Spurgeon used to take his students into the Metropolitan Tabernacle and show them how it was possible to whisper to the back pews.)</em></p></p>
<p>Preachers today have microphones and other assistive technologies that make shouting an entire sermon completely unnecessary. That isn't to say that raising your voice and showing emotion isn't important, sometimes, its a natural outflow of earnestness (which every preacher needs). Preaching in a yell from start to finish though will result in bored people, bad preaching, and a broken-worn out preacher.</p></p>
<p>Other "preacherisms" like hacking and clearing your throat are the product of circumstances from times past that no longer apply to us. Hacking, for instance, started because preachers were working in coal mines and had lung and throat problems - its just been copied by people in a perpetuating cycle even though they live no where near a coal mine. A lot of followers of Jack Hyles clear their throat a lot while they preach, he had medical issues, they don't. Many northern preachers try to preach in a southern accent because some "exciting" preacher they heard was born in Georgia. It doesn't work.</p></p>
<h2>3. Exciting preaching is often culturally motivated (and propagates its own culture)</h2></p>
<p>I've already touched on this, but there is a funny tendency among preachers to take on accents that aren't their own when they preach. It's as if you can't preach well if you aren't southern. I know of a guy from New England, who lived in New England his entire life that talks more like a Tennessean than any I met in Tennessee, presumably because it makes him seem more "preachery". How ridiculous.</p></p>
<p>There is a certain self propagating preacher culture that develops in different parts of the country and it is almost always dangerous. Like inbreeding, it often makes preachers into human charactertures by magnifying their most distinctive traits. What you end up with is churches that make absolutely no sense to visitors and messages muddled by tradition.</p></p>
<h2>4. Exciting preaching isn't sustainable.</h2></p>
<p>Speaking of muddling messages, when a preacher tries to be exciting all of the time, he is shooting for an unsustainable goal. Just like no batter can hit a home run every time he gets to the plate, no preacher can have a "home run" sermon every sunday. Usually, when they swing that hard, they end up wafting hot air at their congregations, and striking out a lot.</p></p>
<p>Many pastors who try to be exciting are mimicking people who are traveling evangelists who preach the same sermons over and over again. These guys can afford to be "home runner hitters" because they get to hit the same pitch every week. If you had to listen to some of these guys every week, it would get old and their strengths would become weaknesses.</p></p>

<p>Along this same line, preachers who aim to be exciting are going to have a tendency to be preach often on what they feel are exciting passages of scripture, and thus fail at preaching "the whole counsel of God".</p></p>
<p>How much better to pace yourself, go line upon line, precept upon precept, and aim for a hit every week? Better yet, just aim to be obedient to your commands to "preach the word" and to "study to show yourself approved unto God". It takes time to turn a field into harvest, just be faithful and do the work.</p></p>
<h2>5. Exciting preaching minimizes reason.</h2></p>
<p>Possibly the biggest danger at trying to being "exciting" is that exciting and reasonable don't mingle well together. God said "come now, and let us reason together" (Isaiah 1:18) not "come now, let me yell at you."</p></p>
<p>The only speaking related qualification given for pastors in scripture is that they be "apt to teach".</p></p>
<p>If you study the recorded sermons of Paul, Peter, and our Lord, you will find that they preached to people's<em> reason</em>. Peter made <em>a case</em> for Christ at Pentecost. Paul <em>reasoned</em> and <em>argued</em> in the synagogues of western Asia, our Lord <em>taught</em> with parables. They weren't, as some preachers are today, working up emotion, they were trying to change people's minds about something . &nbsp;It seems their aim was to line up people's thinking with God's thinking.</p></p>
<p><a href="http://ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/spurgeon-preaching.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160" title="spurgeon-preaching" src="{{ site.url }}/pictures/2012/02/spurgeon-preaching.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="185" /></a></p></p>
<p>In <a title="Light, Fire, Faith, Life, Love" href="http://www.spurgeon.org/misc/aarm06.htm">one</a> of Spurgeon's many lessons on preaching he said that a preacher should aim to have five ingredients in every sermon: "light, fire, faith, life and love." He chose light to come first, because it is through light that the other four are transmitted. &nbsp;Look at this paragraph from the lecture:</p></p>
<blockquote><p>Get plenty of light, brethren,&nbsp;<em>and when you have obtained it, give it out.</em>Never fall into the notion that mere earnestness will suffice without knowledge, and that souls are to be saved simply by our being zealous. I fear that we are more deficient in heat than in light; but, at the same time, that kind of fire which has no light in it is of a very doubtful nature, and cometh not from above. Souls are saved by truth which enters the understanding, and so reaches the conscience. How can the gospel save when it is not understood? The preacher may preach with a great deal of stamping, and hammering, and crying, and entreating; but the Lord is not in the wind, nor in the fire;&mdash;the still small voice of truth is needed to enter the understanding, and thereby reach the heart. People must be taught. We must "go, and teach all nations," making disciples of them; and I know of no way in which you can save men without teaching on your part, and discipleship on theirs.</blockquote></p>
<p>"Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God."</p></p>
<h2>6. Exciting preaching, in the end, isn't all that exciting.</h2></p>
<p>Really exciting preaching is a misnomer. &nbsp;(I tried in vain to think of a better title for this.) When a preacher tries to be exciting, it usually ends up as anything but. It ends up being an unbiblical, manipulative mess or more often, just plain boring.</p></p>
