<p>So much ink has been spilt (or keyboards tapped) on the topic of liberty lately that I hesitate to add to it, but I&rsquo;ve been studying the book of 1 Corinthians and the section I&rsquo;ve been in for the last month mainly addresses our liberty in Christ and how to abuse it. If you were to take account of the famous liberty passages in 1 Corinthians, you would find that about three verses of three chapters deals positively with our liberty in Christ, and the rest of those verses (the vast majority) deal with possible abuses of liberty.</p>
<p><em><strong>On the liberty road, there are ditches on both sides.</strong></em></p>
<p>On the right side of the road is the ditch of legalism. The people that fall into that ditch seem to define their Christian life by negatives. By what they don&rsquo;t do. They don&rsquo;t read anything but the KJV. They don&rsquo;t let their wives wear pants. They don&rsquo;t drink, chew, or run with the girls who do. They won&rsquo;t touch a Keith Getty album with a ten foot pole. They end up spending much of their time combing through the Bible with a fine tooth comb, looking for possible rules, and then applying their knowledge of those rules to others. They become constant <strong>fault finders</strong>. Looking for fault in normal behavior, in other Christians and other churches. Fault finders end up having a lot of conversations that begin with &ldquo;did you hear what so and so are doing?&rdquo; and end with &ldquo;they have a screen, or they sing Steve Green songs, or they wear walking shorts instead of culottes, or (insert your own checklist of extra-biblical rules here).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The left ditch is for license people. These are the people who are so obsessed with their liberty in Christ, that they think it necessary to push it to it&rsquo;s outer limits. They become flaunters. For them, their spirituality is summed up in thumbing their noses at the stupid square legalists, and they see it as a duty to go as far with their liberty as possible and to mock those who would dare suggest that any behavior not specifically condemned in scripture is inappropriate for Christians.</p>
<p>I believe that 1 Corinthians shows the errors of both Fault finders and flaunters. Interestingly, they are both the same things. For the rest of this post, I want to give you <strong>three biblical reasons to be neither a fault finder nor a flaunter</strong>. To be neither a legalist nor a license person:</p>
<h1 id="reason1-bothflauntersandfaultfindersbecomeprideful">Reason # 1 - Both Flaunters and Fault Finders Become Prideful</h1><br />
This reason is found in the very beginning of Paul&rsquo;s conversation about liberty, in <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians8%3A1" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 8:1</a> Paul says</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br />
Most commentators agree that the first half of the verse (The <em>&ldquo;Now as touching the things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge&rdquo;</em> part.) is a quotation from the Corinthians believers. Apparently, there were some in the church that were bragging about there knowledge that let them eat meat offered to idols. From the very beginning, Paul gives them an attitude adjustment, and says <em>&ldquo;knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Now please don&rsquo;t run with that phrase out of this context. God isn&rsquo;t anti-knowlege. He gave us a book of knowledge and He commanded us to study it. If you run with that phrase, I&rsquo;ll run with the phrase at the beginning of chapter 10 <em>&ldquo;Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant.&rdquo;</em> Rabbit trail over.</p>
<p>The point of the passage seems to be that the license crowd had an arrogant attitude toward the legalistic crowd about their knowledge or grace, and if you read on, it seems that the legalistic crowd had the same attitude towards the libertines about their knowledge of law.</p>
<p>How many times have you heard a Christian say &ldquo;Can you believe those guys - they have no understanding of liberty?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Can you believe those guys? Do they even know what the word modest means?&rdquo; At the root of both of those questions, is pride. I know something that you don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m a better Christian than you. I know something that makes me superior to you.</p>
<p>Pride cometh before a fall. A haughty spirit comes before destruction. Pride is one of those abominations that we like to rail on. It&rsquo;s one attitude that is completely foreign to New Testament Christianity. As Paul said later in this conversation <em>&ldquo;wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall&rdquo;</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The second reason not to be either a flaunter or a fault finder is found book ended on this whole topic. Paul starts his conversation about this in chapter 8 and and finishes it with this in chapter 10&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="reason2-neitherflauntingnorfaultfindingarecharitable.">Reason # 2 - Neither Flaunting nor Fault Finding are charitable.</h1></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifyeth.&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians8%3A1" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 8:1</a></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians10%3A33" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 10:33</a></blockquote><br />
The main argument that Paul uses against both abuses of liberty (flaunters and fault finders) is that they aren&rsquo;t acting in love. We so often forget that the greatest commandment is to love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul and mind and to love our neighbor as ourself.</p>
<p>When a person goes on a fault finding mission and tries to find the strictest possible interpretation of everything scripture says about any area of conduct, they are not doing it out of love for their fellow man, but out of some kind of misguided sense of ethics and a broken view of God. (They see God as someone trying to impose himself on people.) Was it charitable for the Pharisees to want Christ to not heal on the sabbath? Was it charitable for the jewish Christians to expect gentile converts to be circumcised?</p>
<p>When a person goes out a&rsquo;flaunting their liberty and pushing it to the extremes, it isn&rsquo;t out of love for fellow man, but out of a selfish unwillingness to be controlled by anyone or anything. It is the very opposite of meekness. It leads to loss of testimony, to idolatry, and to a callous hardness towards other Christians.</p>
<p>Both extremes hurt people. Going out looking for new chains for people to wear isn&rsquo;t loving. Walking so close to the edge that the people who are following you will fall off the cliff isn&rsquo;t loving either. One says &ldquo;God is in heaven and He is against you.&rdquo; the other says &ldquo;God is in heaven and He thinks what you want is all important.&rdquo; Both promote a God contrary to scripture, the God who gives us both freedom and responsability.</p>
<hr />
<p>The third reason can again be found in <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians8%3A1" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>, and it is repeated over the next three chapters:</p>
<h1 id="reason3-neitherflauntingnorfaultfindingbuildupthechurch.">Reason # 3 - Neither Flaunting nor Fault Finding build up the church.</h1></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifyeth.&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/1Corinthians8%3A1" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 8:1</a></blockquote><br />
Paul&rsquo;s criteria for the use of liberty was &ldquo;does it edify (build up)?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great example of this is found in chapter 9. Paul spends a good portion of the chapter (1&ndash;14) making an air-tight case for why he has the right to get paid - but then turns it on it&rsquo;s head and says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to do it.&rdquo; Why? <em>&ldquo;for the gospel&rsquo;s sake&rdquo;</em> (vv.23) Then he tells them that they should strive like athletes who deny themselves so that they can win the prize.</p>
<p>Both fault finders and flaunters turn off lost people.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Why would I want to be a Christian, all you guys do is look for things to condemn?&rdquo; (Fault finders)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why would I want to be a Christian, you guys aren&rsquo;t any different from us?&rdquo; (Flaunters)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why would I want to be a Christian, you guys just want to criticize each other all the time?&rdquo; (Both)</li><br />
</ul><br />
In the Corinthian church this came to the surface over eating meat, but it&rsquo;s not too hard to see the same things over dress codes, over music, or any of the other things that scripture isn&rsquo;t crystal clear on but where we want to take a firm stand in one direction or another.</p>
<p>God has given us liberty. There are grey areas on purpose. But where we land in those grey areas must be guided to scripture, by a love for fellow Christians, and by a purpose of reaching the lost. Let&rsquo;s stay in the middle of liberty road, and stay out of the ditches of legalism and license.</p>
