<p>For most pastors who read this blog, this is probably beyond basic, but here is a video where I explain cross-references and show you how to use Blueletterbible.org to easily add them to a Sunday School Lesson or Sermon.</p>
<p><strong>Below is a loose transcript:</strong></p>
<p>Hi, Pastor Hayden here again from Bible Baptist Church, I want to take a few minutes and show you another quick technique that will help you with your personal Bible Study.</p>
<p>A lot of people equate Bible study with commentaries - books written by preachers and theologians that comments on and explains the Bible. Commentaries are great, I've got a lot of them and I use a lot of them. But there are two things about commentaries that I don't like -</p>
<ul>
<li>first, they are expensive and</li>
<li>second, they are manmade and are full of man's opinions, which means many of them can mislead you.</li><br />
</ul><br />
A long time ago, some one told me "the best commentary on the Bible is the Bible. Sometimes, if you don't get something</p>
<p>an author is saying, it helps to read that author's other books. We should do the same thing when we struggle to understand the Holy Spirit's inspired writings. To put it as the Bible puts it, we should be <em>"comparing spiritual things with spiritual."</em></p>
<p>So, how do you do that?</p>
<p>One way to do that is to study the Bible constantly and comprehensively till you have such a grasp of the whole thing that you can always remember other parts you've read. Sound hard to you? Me too.</p>
<p>A far easier way to do it is with "cross references."</p>
<p>If you were to open your Bible and look down the center column, between the two sets of verses, you'd most likely see a bunch of scripture references. Those are cross references, and that's a great place to start.</p>
<p>But, publishers can only put so many cross references in that tiny space between the columns in your Bible. I want to show you a simpler, and much more comprehensive source of cross references.</p>
<p>A long time ago, I found this old book called "The Treasury of Scripture Knowledge." It's a huge book, and you open it up and it's got tiny, tight print. But it's a book that boasts having over 350,000 cross references. That means for every verse in the Bible, there are more than a dozen cross-references.</p>
<p>R.A. Torrey, one of the great Bible teaching preachers from the early 1900s said that of all the Bible study tools available, none was more important or more useful than the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge.</p>
<p>So when I first got my Treasury of Scripture knowledge, I'd open up the book, find the passage I was studying, and write down all of those tiny cross references, then I'd open up my Bible, or even multiple Bibles so I could read all of the references. It took a lot of time.</p>
<p>I don't even own a copy of the treasury of scripture knowledge anymore, and it takes me a fraction of the time to look up cross-references. Why? Because of a web site I've already showed you called "Blue Letter Bible."</p>
<p>Let me show you how to do a word study with Blue Letter Bible.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open blueletterbible.org.</li>
<li>Type in the reference to the text you are studying.</li>
<li>Find the verse you want to get cross references for and press the tools button.</li><br />
</ol><br />
When you press it, you'll see a box open up below with tabs across the top. We looked at the first tab in another video - the interlinear tab. Next to that is the Bibles tab. Next to that is cross-references.</p>
<p>Let's click on cross references.</p>
<p>You'l notice that the verse is broken into phrases, and that underneath that phrase are a bunch of verses.</p>
<p>There you go. The Treasury of Scripture Knowledge cross references in about 1/100th of the work.</p>
<p>Let me show you one more trick. Next to each verse (and this goes with the regular verse view also) you'll see a little box. You can go through the whole list and click to check the box of each verse you want to use.</p>
<p>Then go to the top of the site and click the copy button.</p>
<p>Now, you can copy all of those verses into microsoft word, pages, or whatever other app you use that takes text.</p>
<p>This is an awesome trick that saves me tons of time and helps me study the Bible better. So I just wanted to share it with you.</p>
