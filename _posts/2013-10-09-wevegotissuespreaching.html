<p>This week I am posting chapters from the book I've been working on "We've Got Issues" about being an Independent Baptist. What follows is chapter 1.</p>
<h1>Issue 1: We&rsquo;ve Abandoned the Bible in our Preaching</h1></p>
<h2>The Ideal</h2></p>
<h3>Ideally, IFB preachers would realize that the Bible comes from God.</h3><br />
I'm sure every preacher has memorized <a href="http://www.bibleserver.com/text/KJV/2Timothy3%3A16-17" class="bibleserver extern" target="_blank">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>. <em>"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works."</em> The simple truth these verses set before us is that God&rsquo;s Word comes from God. God&rsquo;s Word is divine in origin.</p>
<p>It wasn't until prominent scholars started to doubt the God-given nature of all scripture that Fundamentalism as a movement was born. So, in a sense, the bedrock issue of Fundamentalism is belief in the God given nature of all scripture.</p>
<h2>Ideally, IFB preachers would realize that the Bible is God's prescription for the church's wellbeing.</h2><br />
The passage states that <em>"All scripture is given by inspiration of God"</em> but it doesn't end there, it goes on to say <em>"and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works."</em> There can be no doubt that this verse states that all scripture is God-given, but the primary meaning of this passage isn't the origin of God&rsquo;s Word, it is the purpose of God&rsquo;s Word <em>"that the man of God would be perfect".</em></p>
<p>Put another way, this verse plainly teaches that if you want to have healthy Christians, then they have to be exposed to all scripture.</p>
<p>I like to say that Scripture is the church's God given nutrition plan. God wants believers to live on a steady diet of all scripture: Teaching from scripture, preaching from scripture, correction from scripture, encouragement from scripture. If Christians do this, then they will be complete and thoroughly prepared to do the work of God (_"perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works."_)</p>
<p>To take it a step farther, Scripture is the church's curriculum. As a teacher I was never at liberty to teach whatever I wanted, my lessons were tailored to a predetermined curriculum or list of goals and objectives. Through scripture, it is as if God has given us 66 books and said "This is what I want you to teach and study."</p>
<h3>Ideally, IFB Preachers would study the Bible to provide its God-given meaning and God-intended application for the church.</h3><br />
2 Peter says that no scripture is given to <em>"private interpretation.1"</em> We don't get to read God&rsquo;s Word and make up our own meaning and application of it. God had one intended meaning for His Word, and it's our job to study the Bible so that we can learn it and teach it. It doesn't matter what "it means to us", what matters is what God meant when He wrote it.</p>
<p>Again, 2 Timothy says we should <em>"Study to shew thyselves approved unto God. . . rightly dividing the word of truth.2"</em> We know that the study of this is called "hermeneutics", and it has traditionally been the foundation of bible college or seminary education. Before you can preach the Word, you have to learn how to tell what it is saying.</p>
<h3>Ideally, IFB preachers would preach the Word and depend on it for power and authority.</h3><br />
God&rsquo;s Word is <em>"a hammer, that breaketh the rock in pieces.3"</em> God&rsquo;s Word is <em>"quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart4"</em>, and as we've already read, God&rsquo;s Word is what makes us <em>"perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works."</em> Nothing is more necessary for the church than that preachers <em>"preach the word5"</em>.</p>
<h2>The Reality</h2><br />
While many (I'd hope even most) preachers in IFB churches would embrace that ideal, the reality in our pulpits falls far short. How often have we heard a preacher say "I'm just going to preach my heart tonight" or "close your Bibles, you won't be needing them" or "I don't have time to read you the passage, I've got to get done with my outline". At least those preachers are honest, far more often we hear preachers read a passage then preach a message that has very little if not nothing to do with it.6</p>
<p>Despite the ideal, strong, simple, Bible-anchored preaching is the exception in fundamentalism, not the rule. Finding an IFB church where the pastor faithfully studies the Bible then limits himself in practice to the message of Scripture is very hard to do.7</p>
<p>When you hear someone say "That was good preaching," what do they mean? Probably they mean they were emotionally moved by the preacher; they may mean they enjoyed the preacher's delivery; or they may mean that they found the preacher's personality to be appealing, but seldom do they mean they clearly understood what God&rsquo;s Word says and feel the need to act on it.</p>
<p>So if there are a lot of people in the fundamentalist family who aren&rsquo;t preaching the Bible, what are they preaching? I mean, they are still preaching. They are opening the Bible. They are reading from the Bible. They wave it around from time to time. What message has replaced the message of the Bible?</p>
<p>If you accept the above stated biblical ideal and then look back at the last century of fundamentalist history, I think you&rsquo;ll see three things have slowly replaced sound biblical preaching in many American pulpits: <strong>_revivalism, moralism, and pragmatism</strong>_. None of these things are evil in themselves and each one has at least some biblical basis, but each one of these &ldquo;isms&rdquo;, when they were taken to the extreme, had a way of replacing Bible preaching and taking over fundamentalist culture. Let&rsquo;s take a look:</p>
<p>￼<a class="fancybox" title="" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-10-09-at-10.21.02-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1384" alt="Screen Shot 2013-10-09 at 10.21.02 AM" src="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-10-09-at-10.21.02-AM-300x186.png" width="300" height="186" /></a></p>
<h3>Revivalism</h3><br />
Baptists claim to be people of the book, but there are a couple of elements in a typical fundamental Baptist church service that are completely foreign to the Bible. The calling out of "amen" as the preacher preaches and the invitation at the end of every service are found nowhere in Scripture. So where did they come from?</p>
<p>Both of those practices, and many other cultural elements of Independent Baptist churches, got the their start in the "Camp Meetings" and revivals of the 1800s. Revivals are a part of American tradition that goes back further than the nation itself. In Colonial America, the first Great Awakening saw the rise of the revivalist George Whitfield and his imitators. After the First Great Awakening (and a Second), Methodism was the most popular religion in America and had institutionalized revival camp meetings throughout the rural frontier8. Charles Finney came about in the early 1800s and added to the mix the invention of the altar call9. Picking up where Finney left off, the evangelist D.L. Moody was one of the most popular people in the states following the civil war and held revival meetings all across the country. Moody trained a contingent of lieutenants, that after his retirement carried on the revivalist tradition, men like R.A. Torrey and J. Wilbur Chapman10. Chapman passed the mantel to a former major league baseball player named Billy Sunday who, during the first quarter of the 1900's, was the most famous fundamentalist in the world11.</p>
<p>In the late 1800's and early 1900's when fundamentalism took its form, it was learned men like R.A. Torrey (a Yale graduate who studied in Germany for a year), college presidents like Charles Blanchard (Wheaton) and Princeton Theologians like B.B. Warfield and J. Gresham Machen who drew the intellectual battle plans and crystalized fundamentalist doctrine. It's a mistake, however, to think of these men as the founders of modern fundamentalism. The doctrines and ideas of Fundamentalism may have been formulated by scholarly men like J. Gresham Machan and C.I. Scofield, but it was popularized by evangelists and revivalists like Billy Sunday (and later Billy Graham), and it took its greatest hold among the already revivalistic Baptists and Methodists in the south.12</p>
<p>There undoubtedly were revivals and revivalistic characters in the Bible and there can be no doubt that God worked through revivals at different periods in American history. There is, however, a difference between revivals and revivalism. Revivals are an organic work of God, revivalism is trying to reproduce the excitement and appeal of revivals through various human methods.</p>
<p>So how do our roots in revivalism contribute to a lack of biblicism in our pulpits? The bible contains a lot of teaching that is great material for revival services and evangelistic campaigns, but it also contains a lot of material that just isn't. Can you imagine a preacher teaching through Proverbs in a mass evangelistic crusade? The truth is if you are going to preach the whole counsel of God, you are going to preach as many messages that don't lend themselves to an altar call as you are messages that do. If we force every sermon to be emotional or convicting we are either going to ignore half the Bible or leave people very confused about what it says.</p>
<p>For a long, long time fundamentalists (especially Independent Baptists) have relied on a revivalistic culture to attract and retain members. The problem with that is that the revivalistic culture doesn't lend itself to a bible teaching culture.13</p>
<h3>Moralism</h3><br />
Historians of fundamentalism will talk about two waves where fundamentalism crystalized. The first was the fundamentalist-modernist debate of the late 1800's and early 1900's but most of us are far removed from that debate, and if we are honest, there are many who do not call themselves fundamentalists who we would say come down on the right side of the original fundamentalist-modernist debate14. The second crucible that fundamentalism flowed out of was the social changes of the middle of the 1900s. It was during these social changes, beginning with the scopes trial and prohibition in the 1920s and extending through the cultural upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s that really saw the birth of the fundamentalist movement that we know today.</p>
<p><a class="fancybox" title="" href="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-10-09-at-10.21.14-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1385" alt="Screen Shot 2013-10-09 at 10.21.14 AM" src="http://www.ryan-hayden.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-10-09-at-10.21.14-AM-255x300.png" width="255" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>During this time, the popular leaders of fundamentalism were men like Texas pastor J. Frank Norris, Evangelist Bob Jones, and later pastor, evangelist and newspaper editor John R. Rice. These fundamentalist leaders lived through one of the greatest times of social upheaval in the history of the world and witnessed to their dismay the dismantling of the moral underpinning of american society; they were not silent about it. A huge emphasis among fundamentalists became the evils of alcohol and evolution. Later, things like rock music, dancing, theatre attendance, Hollywood and television, hippies, sexual experimentation and woman's dress styles became regular pet topics preached in fundamentalist pulpits.</p>
<p>When it became popular for woman to wear short hair and pants, men like John R. Rice would write a book like Bobbed Hair, Bossy Wives, and Woman Preachers. When the hippies started popularizing the style of men wearing long hair and a beard, fundamentalist preachers started railing against men with long hair and "unkempt" facial hair and even went so far as to produce tracts that explained that Jesus didn't wear a beard and only had it ripped out because during his night in the garden and trial he hadn't had time to shave.</p>
<p>￼</p>
<p>Does the Bible speak about the issues of our day? Of course it does. There are principles in it that can and should be applied to our dress, gender issues, alcohol, music, entertainment, sexuality and almost anything else that we come across. The important thing to note is that none of these issues are a theme of scripture. During the middle of the last century, because of the social upheaval, these things became for some the theme of fundamentalist preaching.</p>
<p>At some point during these years these issues got the term "standards". When I was growing up and listening to the preaching in churches, I was under the distinct impression that at least 50% of the Bible had to do with standards. I don't think I heard many messages where the word wasn't mentioned and unfortunately there are many preachers in fundamentalism that are still giving that impression.</p>
<p>The truth is, the word "standards" isn't found in scripture at all. The closest thing to this kind of moral to do list that we see in scripture is the conduct of the Pharisees that Christ railed against. The rising of the idea of standards and its prominence in pulpits was nothing more than some fundamentalists answer to the rapid moral decay and cultural changes that they saw in the world around them, the problem with that is that it diverts attention from what the Bible actually says.</p>
<p>I believe with all of my heart and have seen it worked out that if a preacher diligently studies his Bible and preaches it as truth, then his congregants are going to be moral people that reject the cultural relativism and decay of the day. Standards and moralism is a short cut that ends up robbing people of the greater meaning of the Bible and creates simplistic judgmental Christians.</p>
<p>I'll never forget a conversation I had with a pastor once. I asked him why he didn't preach more on the love of Christ, on the doctrine of salvation, and other things so prominent in scripture. His answer was "Our church is filled with so many people that don't have standards yet." Apparently, he thought standards were more important to his people than the great themes of the Bible. A quick reading of scripture would show you God doesn't share his opinion.</p>
<p>Another time I was interviewing for a job as a youth pastor in a fundamental church. After filling out a long questionnaire that included questions about what my wife wore to bed, the pastor actually told me emphatically "the emphasis of my ministry is standards". I didn't get the job (and I didn't want it after that).</p>
<p>God didn't give us a short list of moral do's and don'ts or standards, he gave us 66 books to study and preach. In my opinion, nothing has driven more young people away from fundamentalism than its extra-biblical emphasis on standards and few things have been so detrimental to the cause of biblical preaching than the emphasis on standards.15</p>
<h3>Pragmatism</h3><br />
Fundamentalists like to rail against the unbridled pragmatism of the current church growth movement. The historical truth is, fundamentalists were the original pragmatic church growth movement.</p>
<p>Charles Finney invented the altar call and called people out from his pulpit for pragmatic reasons. D.L. Moody, a hero and of many fundamentalists, preached a simplified message of salvation and refrained from preaching about hell saying "terror never brought a man in yet"16. J. Frank Norris talked about "making a deliberate switch from expository messages to more sensational topics" because his church wasn't growing fast enough17. (He would print sensational sermon topics in the local newspaper like "The Ten Biggest Devils In Fort Worth, Names Given"18) Jack Hyles talked about having a list of a dozen or so topics that he always preached on because "it brought results". Some fundamentalists went so far as to boil the Christian message down to the "3 S's": Salvation, Separation, and Service.</p>
<p>Preaching should be simple. Salvation is for those who become &ldquo;as a little child."19 Paul said that his preaching was &ldquo;not with man&rsquo;s wisdom&rdquo;20, Christ never preached without a parable and put everything in simple terms. Ideally, preachers should study the Bible and present its message in a simple enough way that the masses can understand it.</p>
<p>But pragmatism has caused many fundamentalists to take their preaching from simple to simplistic. Instead of preaching the whole council of God in a way that is understandable to the masses, many fundamentalist have with their preaching created an abridged version thats so oversimplified that it barely resembles the source.</p>
<p>Pragmatic topical preaching is safe. People who go to churches where the preacher preaches like this never have to wrestle with what the Bible actually says about confusing doctrines like election and eternal security, they never have to question the bounds of Christian liberty, and seldom hear about sins they actually commit (like pride, malice, and gossiping). You can, however, only live on milk so long. Pragmatic preaching can only produce human results. If we want to see divine work, our preaching has to follow the divine recipe.21</p>
<h2>How do we fix this?</h2><br />
The lack of strong Bible preaching is the biggest issue that fundamentalists face. Every other issue in this book would go away if preachers would limit themselves to preaching the whole council of God. Despite this, this may be a problem that is too ingrained to remove, but the following ideas might help:</p>
<p>Demand that preacher's rightly divide the Word of Truth.</p>
<p>There are things that I don't like that I can live with, but I will not listen to a preacher who abuses and misuses the Bible. The time has come for us to demand that our preachers be Bible preachers who spend time in study and at the very least present scripture in its context. Preachers can chop the Bible up and make it say whatever they want it to say, but they're not preaching God&rsquo;s Words. If fundamentalism is really a movement about staying true to the Bible, then nothing is more fundamental than biblical preaching. If it can't be an acid test for fellowship, it should at least be an acid test for our pulpits.</p>
<h3>Go back to biblical, Bible-directed preaching.</h3><br />
One thing that will surely keep revivalism at bay and keep pragmatism and moralism from dominating our pulpits is to return to the time honored tradition of Bible-directed preaching, whether it be expository or contextual. Our homiletical style isn&rsquo;t the important thing, the important thing is that we make sure the message comes from the text and that we allow God, through His Word, to determine the direction of our preaching. If God&rsquo;s Word is really God given, then maybe God knew what he was doing in arranging the Word the way he did and maybe He thought we needed all of it. No matter how careful they are a topical preacher is always going to leave some parts out.</p>
<h3>Count the cost of promoting "exciting" preachers instead of Bible teaching preachers.</h3><br />
The pulpits of Fundamentalist Bible colleges and their parent churches are sacred ground for Independent Baptists. Fortunately, most IFB colleges promote biblical preaching in the classroom. Unfortunately, it's common for them to promote something altogether different through the chapel hour and special conferences. A revivalistic speaker with a dynamic personality might get the students excited and might fill the altars, but we would hope that the leaders consider the long term cost of confusing students about what is and isn't acceptable Bible preaching.</p>

<p>6 For example, two of Jack Hyles most famous sermons &ldquo;Is There No King In You&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fresh Oil&rdquo; have almost nothing to do with their texts.</p>
<p>7 I&rsquo;m avoiding the term &ldquo;Expository Preaching&rdquo; because I think that too has pitfalls.

<p>13 The other problems with Revivalistic culture are it&rsquo;s innate Anti-Intellectualism (the next chapter is on this) and it&rsquo;s tendency to be driven by a unique regional culture (visit a few churches in the South if you don&rsquo;t know what I mean).</p>
<p>14 Many popular contemporary non-fundamentalist evangelical leaders are constantly attacking any kind of modernism. John MacArthur and Al Mohler are good examples.</p>
<p>15 I think there is a difference between an emphasis on standards and institutional guidelines and rules. In my opinion, There is nothing wrong with a pastor and church making decisions about a dress code for Sunday School teachers and choir members, or a school requiring its girls to wear dresses to class. It's when those rules replace the Bible as the emphasis in the pulpit that it becomes an "issue".</p>
