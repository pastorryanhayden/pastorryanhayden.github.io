<p>I am an Independent Fundamental Baptist. &nbsp;Not because of&nbsp;necessity&nbsp; not because my parents are, not because I went to an IFB school or most of my friends are Independent Fundamental Baptists, but because I want to be and because I believe that the original ideals of Independent Fundamental Baptists are closest to what scripture says a church should be.</p>
<p>On this blog, I write regularly about why I am an Independent Fundamental Baptist, and why I think we as a group have some serious issues that need to be worked through. &nbsp;(Incidentally, I am working on a book about this topic.) &nbsp;If this is your first time here, let me suggest some articles to get you up to speed:</p>
